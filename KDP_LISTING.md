### Description (copy this exactly)
```
What if your mind were the only one that truly exists?

This book explores that provocative question by taking solipsism—the philosophical view that only one's own mind is certain—and running it through the machinery of modern theoretical physics.

From quantum mechanics to black holes, from the Big Bang to the nature of time itself, each chapter reinterprets familiar physics through the lens of a single observer. The result is not a new theory, but a thought experiment: how far can observer-centric ideas be pushed while remaining internally consistent?

You'll explore:
• How relational quantum mechanics and QBism already place the observer at center stage
• What spacetime geometry might look like if built around a single worldline
• Why the information paradox dissolves when there's only one perspective
• How dreams, memory, and imagination fit into a universe-of-one
• What the Big Bang might mean as the birth of the observer

This is not a physics textbook. It makes no testable predictions. Instead, it's philosophy dressed in the language of physics—an invitation to see the cosmos not as a stage on which observers appear, but as a structure woven around a single experiencing subject.

By the end, you may see familiar physics in a new light: not as detached laws governing an indifferent cosmos, but as a narrative woven for one consciousness.
