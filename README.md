# Solipsistic-Physics
This is a theory of everything derived from M Theory but incorporating the philosophy of solipsism

This repository will lay out a structure for a book with chapters that will teach the theory of solipsistic physics. Chapters will be arranged in a way such that the learner will go from a basic understanding of string theory into M theory, but always being directed by the philosophy of solipsism.

Keep everything in a format suitable for publishing a book, including the use of latex for mathematics.
