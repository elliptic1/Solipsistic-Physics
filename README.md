# Solipsistic-Physics
This is a theory of everything derived from M Theory but incorporating the philosophy of solipsism

this repository will lay out a structure for a course or a book with chapters that will teach the theory of solipsistic physics. the chapters will be arranged in a way such that the learner will go from a basic understanding of string theory into in theory, but always being directed by the philosophy of solipsism

The contents of the repo should be in a format suitable for a book that can be published, including the use of latex for mathematics.
