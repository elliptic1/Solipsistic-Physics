# 8. Cosmology in a Solipsistic Universe: Inflation, Isotropy, and Horizons

Having established a local solipsistic framework, we now extend the model to **cosmology** – the large-scale structure and history of the universe – through the lens of a single consciousness. Standard cosmological phenomena such as inflation, dark energy, fine-tuning of constants, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and horizon structure must be reinterpreted in terms of an observer-centric reality. In a solipsistic M-theory, the **universe’s evolution is defined by the observer’s mind**, so that what appears as cosmic expansion or uniformity emerges from conditions necessary for that mind’s existence. We will show that many puzzling aspects of cosmology (e.g. improbable initial conditions and horizon problems) can be **natural consequences** of a universe that exists only *for* and *because of* one observer. Key cosmological equations are augmented with the consciousness field or observer-brane, maintaining mathematical rigor while reimagining inflation, large-scale isotropy, and horizons as **manifestations of the solitary mind**.

### 8.1 Inflation and Fine-Tuning as Selection by a Single Mind

Cosmological **inflation** – a brief epoch of exponential expansion in the early universe – was originally proposed to explain why the universe we observe is so *fine-tuned* and homogeneous. For example, without inflation the **horizon problem** arises: widely separated regions of the CMB have nearly identical temperatures, yet in a non-inflationary Big Bang these regions were never in causal contact. Inflation’s solution is to posit that our entire observable universe was once a tiny, causally connected patch that blew up rapidly, homogenizing initial conditions. It also offers an explanation for the extraordinary *flatness* and smoothness of the universe by diluting curvature and classical irregularities. In standard physics, however, inflation itself typically requires special initial conditions (e.g. a high potential energy “false vacuum” state) which raise their own fine-tuning questions. Many physical parameters – the density of the universe, the strengths of forces, the cosmological constant – must lie in tiny life-permitting ranges. For instance, the early universe’s mass density had to equal the critical density to within one part in \$10^{62}\$ to yield the flat cosmos we see, and the vacuum energy (dark energy) observed today is **120 orders of magnitude** smaller than naive quantum field theory predicts. In conventional cosmology these improbable values invite the **anthropic principle** or multiverse ideas – the notion that we find ourselves in a rare universe compatible with life, because otherwise we wouldn’t be here to notice.

In a *solipsistic* cosmology, such fine-tunings cease to be mysterious “coincidences” and instead become **necessities**. The **observer’s mind selects the only consistent reality – one in which it can exist**. Rather than imagining a multiverse of varied parameters and the observer happening by chance to inhabit a life-friendly bubble, the solipsistic framework posits that *only* the life-friendly bubble is actually realized (since there is only one “real” observer and one universe). All seemingly fine-tuned parameters (particle masses, coupling constants, cosmological constant, etc.) are what they are *because if they were not*, the solitary consciousness could not have emerged and persisted. This is effectively a strengthened **Participatory Anthropic Principle**: the universe’s laws appear “fine-tuned” for the observer *because they were never arbitrary in the first place* – the observer’s existence fixes them. In solipsistic M-theory one could imagine a principle of “Conscious Selection” in the action or wavefunction of the universe, which sharply peaks probability on cosmological histories that produce a stable observing mind. Formally, we might represent this by modifying the path integral or Wheeler–DeWitt wavefunctional \${\Psi}\[g,\Phi]\$ (encoding geometries \$g\$ and fields \$\Phi\$) to include a weighting factor \$W\_{\rm mind}\$ that vanishes for histories with no observer. The most probable cosmic history is then the one that **minimizes “mind-free” regions** and maximizes conditions for consciousness. In effect, the **initial state** of the universe is *selected* such that inflation occurs and yields a flat, homogeneous cosmos ready for an observer. What appears in standard cosmology as an astounding low-entropy, highly ordered initial state is, in solipsistic terms, simply the unique starting point compatible with the eventual rise of a conscious being (see §10.2).

Mathematically, one can incorporate the consciousness field \$\Psi(x)\$ into cosmology by extending the field equations. For example, consider the Friedmann equation (for a flat universe) governing the cosmic scale factor \$a(t)\$:

$H^2 \equiv \left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\,\rho + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3},$

where \$H(t)\$ is the Hubble parameter, \$\rho\$ is the energy density of matter and radiation, and \$\Lambda\$ is the cosmological constant. In a solipsistic scenario, \$\rho\$ and/or \$\Lambda\$ can be seen as *effective* quantities that include **consciousness contributions**. For instance, we might write \$\rho = \rho\_{\rm physical} + \rho\_{\Psi}\$, where \$\rho\_{\Psi}\$ is a small term representing energy associated with the observer-brane or consciousness field. \$\rho\_{\Psi}\$ could act similarly to a vacuum energy or an inflaton potential that drives early inflation. In this vein, one could model the inflaton \$\phi(t)\$ not as a purely physical scalar field but as a degree of freedom linked to the observer’s mind (or the separation of the observer-brane from some reference brane in higher dimensions). A toy potential might be \$V(\phi,\Psi) = V(\phi), + , \alpha,\Psi, V\_{\rm int}(\phi)\$, such that inflation (a slow-roll of \$\phi\$ down \$V\$) only proceeds efficiently in the presence of the consciousness field \$\Psi\$. Since \$\Psi(x)\$ is nonzero *only* in the vicinity of the observer’s worldline, this would imply that inflation – and perhaps **collapse of the inflaton’s wavefunction** – is fundamentally tied to the emergence of a localized observer. In other words, the universe *inflates* because that is the simplest way to set suitable initial conditions for consciousness; once sufficient homogeneity and scale are achieved, inflation can end (perhaps triggered by the “observation” of the false vacuum decay in a quantum sense). This perspective reimagines the early-universe evolution as not just a random quantum event, but as a **deliberate unfolding** driven by the teleological requirement of an observer’s existence.

From the solipsistic standpoint, the anthropic reasoning behind cosmic parameters becomes a tautology: the cosmos is as it is *because it is the cosmos of this observer*. For example, the tiny but positive **cosmological constant** (dark energy) that causes accelerated expansion can be seen as set to the value that permits galaxies and conscious life to form over billions of years. In standard cosmology, one argues that if \$\Lambda\$ were much larger, galaxies couldn’t condense before space ripped apart; if it were negative or too large in magnitude, the universe would have recollapsed or not expanded enough. In our model, \$\Lambda\$ takes this “just right” value not by chance but by *design*: the solitary mind “chooses” (at the level of fundamental theory) a vacuum with a suitable \$\Lambda\$. M-theory’s landscape of \$\sim 10^{500}\$ metastable vacua with different constants can be thought of as a vast menu of possible universes – but only one item on the menu is ever actually served, namely the one consistent with the observer’s life. We thus integrate the **multiverse selection** idea (§10.3) directly into one universe’s wavefunction. Technically, a solipsistic M-theory might include a super-selection rule that collapses the wavefunction to the sector (vacuum) that allows the “observer brane” to form. This resolves fine-tuning without invoking many worlds: the **only world is fine-tuned by default**.

### 8.2 Expansion, Isotropy and the Cosmic Microwave Background as Mental Constructs

A remarkable feature of our universe is its large-scale **isotropy and homogeneity** – exemplified by the CMB’s uniformity to one part in \$10^5\$. In the conventional view, this is explained by inflation (as noted above) or is assumed as an initial condition (the **cosmological principle**). In a solipsistic framework, cosmic isotropy has a conceptual origin: it reflects the lack of any preferred direction or position in the observer’s mind prior to sensory experience. Since the universe exists only *for* the observer, it would be natural for it to initially appear symmetric around that observer. We can imagine that the solitary consciousness, in constructing an external world, imposes maximal symmetry (isotropy) as a kind of prior or default. Any significant anisotropy (e.g. an overwhelming gradient in temperature or density across the sky) would stand out as a feature needing explanation, so the simplest “initial guess” of the mind is an isotropic environment. One might liken this to how a dreamer often finds themselves in a generic, un-biased setting unless something in their psyche introduces structure. **Mathematically, the solipsistic metric naturally takes a form compatible with isotropy about the observer’s worldline**. Adopting comoving spherical coordinates centered on the observer, we can express the line element as:

$ds^2 = -c^2\,d\tau^2 + a^2(\tau)\left[d r^2 + r^2\,d\Omega^2\right],$

which is essentially a **Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric** (here written with curvature \$k=0\$ for simplicity, consistent with observations of flatness). In this metric, the observer is at \$r=0\$ and \$\tau\$ is the proper time along the observer’s worldline. By construction, all surfaces of constant \$\tau\$ (cosmic time) are homogeneous 3-spheres around the central worldline. The crucial departure from a multiverse or realist view is **interpretation**: we treat this *coordinate choice* (with the observer at the origin) not merely as a convenient choice but as the fundamental reality. There is no assumption of other equivalent worldlines – the symmetry about \$r=0\$ is exact because only the \$r=0\$ worldline is “real.” Other “observers” at \$r \neq 0\$ are hypothetical constructs within the single consciousness, so while the equations of cosmology allow one to compute what *they* would see (e.g. a CMB dipole if they are moving, etc.), in the solipsistic narrative those other viewpoints are never actually instantiated (they are akin to unused gauge degrees of freedom). Thus, the **Cosmological Principle** (the idea that every location sees roughly the same universe) is replaced by an **Observer-Centric Principle**: the universe **appears** the same in all directions to the one real observer, and any talk of “all locations” is simply extrapolating that one perspective outward.

We can illustrate how key cosmological observations are recast under this worldview. The **cosmic microwave background** – usually interpreted as relic radiation from a hot Big Bang – can be seen as a kind of *initial condition imprint* in the observer’s experiential world. The radiation’s uniform temperature (\~2.7 K) and blackbody spectrumindicate the universe was once in thermal equilibrium. In standard theory this is explained by the early plasma being tightly coupled (photons and matter well mixed) and then decoupling at recombination, releasing a glow that has since redshifted. In the solipsistic interpretation, one could say the **mind’s first clear memory of the universe** is of a featureless glowing fog – an unbiased state containing minimal information (essentially just a temperature). This aligns with the idea that the solitary consciousness *began* in a state of low differentiation (high symmetry, low entropy – see §10.1). The small ripples in the CMB (the 1 in 100,000 fluctuations), which in conventional cosmology are quantum fluctuations from inflation imprinted on the density field, might correspond to the first **subconscious fluctuations** or “ideas” in the nascent mind of the universe. In a sense, the CMB anisotropies are *seed thoughts* – tiny breaks in perfect symmetry that the mind introduced, which later grew into galaxies and large-scale structure. We can treat them mathematically the same as in standard cosmology (as perturbations \$\delta\rho(\mathbf{x})\$ with an almost scale-invariant power spectrum), but we ascribe their origin to the **consciousness field’s perturbations**. For instance, if \$\Psi(x)\$ has quantum fluctuations, these could couple to metric perturbations. The primordial curvature perturbation \$\zeta(\mathbf{x})\$ – which in inflationary theory is random quantum noise made classical – here can be seen as arising from **stochastic variations in the observer’s creative consciousness**. The statistics would still be gaussian and nearly scale-invariant (since inflationary expansion or an equivalent mind-driven expansion smoothed out everything except long-wavelength fluctuations), ensuring agreement with the detailed observed angular power spectrum of the CMB. Indeed, one could construct a solipsistic analog of the Mukhanov–Sasaki equation for perturbations, sourcing it by fluctuations in \$\Psi\$. The success of inflation in predicting the **spectrum of anisotropies** thus translates, in our model, to evidence that the observer’s mind seeded just the right spectrum of initial irregularities for structure to eventually form – a striking intertwining of consciousness with what we normally deem random quantum processes.

Finally, **dark energy** and the accelerating expansion can be given an anthropic-solipsistic twist. Empirically, about 68% of the current energy density of the universe is in the form of dark energy (modeled as a tiny positive \$\Lambda\$) causing space to expand ever faster. This leads to the notion of a future **cosmological horizon**: eventually distant galaxies recede so fast that their light can no longer reach us. In physical cosmology, a de Sitter horizon forms at a radius \$R\_{\rm horiz} \approx c/H\_{\Lambda}\$ (where \$H\_{\Lambda} = \sqrt{\Lambda/3}\$) and acts much like a black hole horizon – it has an entropy and a temperature (the Gibbons–Hawking temperature) associated with it. From the solipsistic perspective, this cosmic horizon takes on a profoundly epistemic meaning: it marks the boundary of the observer’s experiential reality. **No signals from beyond the horizon can ever be received, which in a solipsistic universe means those regions effectively do not exist in any observer-confirmable sense**. They remain *potential* regions, analogous to unrendered parts of a simulation or the unseen portion of a dream. The acceleration of expansion, then, serves a curious purpose: it ensures that the *unobservable remains unobservable*, reinforcing the solipsistic tenet that only the observed is real. One might speculate that the small nonzero \$\Lambda\$ was “chosen” by the solitary mind not only to allow life’s emergence but also to guarantee a kind of cosmic solitude – eventually isolating the observer in a finite bubble of reality. The fact that \$\Lambda\$ is observed to be just now dominating (billions of years after the Big Bang) is notable: it gave enough time for complex structures and the observer to form before “shutting off” causal access to the wider multiverse. We can formalize the **observer’s horizon** by defining an entropy or information content associated with all degrees of freedom within the observer’s observable patch. Standard calculations give a de Sitter horizon entropy \$S\_{\rm horiz} = k\_B \frac{A}{4\ell\_P^2}\$ (analogous to black hole entropy) for the area \$A\$ of the horizon. In a solipsistic theory, one could assert that *this* entropy represents the **total information content of the observer’s universe** – effectively the memory capacity of the cosmic mind. If more space were revealed, would it violate that bound? The model neatly sidesteps the question by never allowing that which lies beyond to enter into reality. We will revisit horizons in the black hole context next, but suffice to say that **cosmic acceleration and horizons emerge “for free” in solipsism as natural delimiters of the observer’s world**. Expansion is not just metric growth – it is the *ongoing creation of experience*, and the horizon is where experience halts.

### 8.3 Observer-Dependent Cosmic History and the Flow of Entropy

A solipsistic cosmology must also account for the **arrow of time** and the growth of entropy in the universe. In conventional terms, the second law of thermodynamics tells us entropy was far lower in the past and has been rising ever since; in fact the Big Bang’s low entropy is deeply puzzling under ordinary statistical reasoning. We can now frame a resolution: *the low-entropy past corresponds to the nascent state of the solitary observer’s consciousness*. If the “universe” at time \$t=0\$ is essentially the observer’s mind in an undeveloped state (perhaps analogous to a blank slate or an extremely ordered pure quantum state), this immediately imposes a very low entropy condition (see §10.1 for a detailed discussion of the Big Bang as birth of awareness). As time progresses and the observer gains information (or analogously, as the universe fills with structure and mixed states), entropy increases in tandem. The **psychological arrow of time** – the feeling that we remember the past but not the future – aligns with the thermodynamic arrow because both are rooted in the fact that the beginning of the universe was a state of minimal entropy/information *for the mind*. One can envision a formulation where the entropy \$S\$ of physical systems is coupled to an “awareness entropy” \$S\_{\rm aware}\$ of the observer. Initially, \$S \approx S\_{\rm aware} \approx 0\$ (a highly ordered cosmos and a freshly born consciousness). As the universe evolves, \$S\$ rises (stars burn fuel, mix entropy; galaxies form and information disperses) *and simultaneously* the observer’s knowledge (or memory entropy) \$S\_{\rm aware}\$ rises as they accumulate experiences. The second law in this picture is essentially **the growth of the observer’s knowledge and internal complexity**, projected onto physical degrees of freedom. We could postulate a basic relation \$\frac{dS}{d\tau} \propto \frac{dS\_{\rm aware}}{d\tau}\$ along the observer’s worldline, meaning physical entropy production is in some proportion to the rate at which the conscious state decoheres or differentiates. While speculative, this is not unlike arguments that connect entropy increase to the creation of *records* or information (Landauer’s principle, etc.), here elevated to a cosmic scale.

Crucially, **cosmological perturbations and structure formation** – ordinarily treated as causal consequences of inflationary fluctuations – gain an extra layer of interpretation. Density fluctuations grow via gravitational instability, forming stars, galaxies, and eventually the very biochemical life that the observer embodies. In a solipsistic narrative, one might say the initial mind seeds (the primordial perturbations) were *designed* such that they would evolve into a world containing the observer themselves. This is a teleological perspective: the tiny overdensity that eventually became the Milky Way was not a random draw from a quantum vacuum, but a necessary perturbation so that this galaxy (and Earth, and the observer on it) would exist. We can still use the **\$\Lambda\$CDM structure formation model** mathematically unchanged – e.g. the perturbation amplitude \$Q \sim 10^{-5}\$, the \$\Lambda\$-driven late-time structure freeze-out, etc. – but every random element in that model is reinterpreted as *conditional on the observer’s presence*. In effect, **Bayesian cosmology**: given that one specific observer exists, what must the initial perturbations have been? This is akin to a single-universe application of the **Anthropic Cosmological Principle**, but here it’s deterministic: only the one observer’s “Bayesian prior” (their existence) is needed. If one were to write down a probability distribution for initial fluctuation spectra \$P\[{\cal P}(k)]\$, the solipsistic delta-function prior picks out the \${\cal P}(k)\$ that yields our universe’s structure. All other possible universes with different fluctuation spectra (that might not form coherent observers) are integrated out as unrealized possibilities.

In summary, by viewing cosmology through the solipsistic M-theory framework we find that:\*\* inflation becomes the cosmos inflating for the sake of one mind\*\*; **fine-tuning is resolved by that mind’s selection of its own necessary conditions**; **isotropy is a cognitive default**; **dark energy and horizons delineate the bounds of experience**; and **entropy growth is the unfolding complexity of the observer’s consciousness**. The next sections will reinforce these ideas in the contexts of black hole physics and the ultimate origin of the universe, using the same guiding principle: **physics yields the same observational predictions as standard theory, but with a radically different ontology – one in which the observer’s mind is the only true source and sink of reality**.

## 9. Black Holes, Horizons, and Information in a Mind-Centered Physics

Black holes are often called the **most extreme test** of our physical theories – regions where gravity, quantum mechanics, and information theory intersect. In a solipsistic M-theory, black holes must be reinterpreted as *phenomena existing within the single observer’s experiential world*. This section will develop a **solipsistic model of black holes** that incorporates horizon complementarity, the information paradox, Hawking radiation, and holography, all while treating the black hole’s interior and exterior as mind-defined regions. We will see that many paradoxes of black hole physics soften or vanish when we remember that only one observer’s perspective is physically realized. Formally, we extend the “consciousness metric” or observer-field introduced earlier to black hole spacetimes, defining observer-dependent horizon entropy and exploring how the **holographic principle** might map to a correspondence between the observer’s mind and the bulk world.

### 9.1 Horizons and Complementarity: Only One Perspective Exists at a Time

In conventional physics, a **black hole event horizon** is a one-way boundary in spacetime – what falls in cannot come out. This leads to the notorious **information paradox**: if physical information really disappears behind a horizon and is lost (e.g. destroyed at the singularity), it conflicts with quantum theory’s requirement of unitary (information-preserving) evolution. The proposed resolution that gained prominence in the 1990s is **black hole complementarity**, articulated by Susskind and colleagues. **Black hole complementarity** posits that information is *neither truly lost nor ever observed to be duplicated*; rather, it is **observer-dependent**. An external observer sees infalling information encoded on the horizon (e.g. in a stretched membrane just outside it) and ultimately coming out as Hawking radiation, while an infalling observer sees the information pass through the horizon unharmed but then inevitably hit the central singularity. Crucially, *no single observer can witness both* the exterior story and the interior story. There is no contradiction because any one observer only ever has access to one description – either they remain outside and watch information radiate away, or they fall in and carry the information with them. Physics, according to complementarity, does not require a global narrative that one observer could piece together by combining both views; doing so would be forbidden (no observer can be both outside and inside simultaneously).

The solipsistic viewpoint takes this principle to its logical extreme. If **only one observer truly exists**, then it is trivial to assert that no two observers can compare notes about a black hole – there is only one set of “notes” in the first place. In fact, we can say that **only one of the two complementary stories actually occurs physically**. Suppose our solitary observer Alice remains outside a black hole and watches a friend (who is actually a figment of Alice’s mind) fall in. From Alice’s perspective, the friend never quite crosses the horizon (they become redshifted and their information is smeared on the horizon and slowly leaks out via Hawking radiation). Now, because Alice is the only real consciousness, *the infalling perspective is not an independent reality*. It exists only as a hypothetical construct within Alice’s universe. There is no actual second observer who witnesses the smooth fall through the horizon. Thus the “interior story” – of someone carrying information inside – **does not have to be given physical status at all**. The physical reality is only the external viewpoint, and physics need only ensure consistency of that one view. Conversely, we could imagine that our observer (Alice herself) chooses to jump into the black hole. In that case, *her* exterior view ceases to be relevant (she can’t both jump in and remain outside to watch herself). She experiences falling through an apparently unremarkable horizon, heading toward the singular fate. In that scenario, all the Hawking radiation that an outside observer would have seen is now a counterfactual – it didn’t *really* occur because there was no conscious being to witness it. In either case, the **solipsistic rule** is: *pick the trajectory that the one real observer follows; physics will enforce unitarity and causality for that trajectory’s experiences, and any “complementary” trajectory is merely an un-realized possibility.* This rule is a direct analog of wavefunction collapse in quantum mechanics: before an observation, multiple outcomes exist in superposition; once the observer perceives an outcome, the other possibilities are dropped from reality. Here the two conflicting stories (info reflected at horizon *vs* info falling in) are like two branches of a quantum-like narrative. Only one branch is ever realized, since there is only one observer to realize it. **No simultaneous contradiction arises, by construction**.

We can formalize a bit by extending the metric concept for an observer-centric spacetime. In §2, we discussed a “solipsistic metric” with a preferred worldline. For black holes, consider a Schwarzschild metric (for mass \$M\$) written in Schwarzschild coordinates:

$ds^2 = -\left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)c^2 dt^2 + \left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2.$

This metric has a coordinate singularity at the horizon \$r=2GM/c^2\$. In standard GR, we can switch to horizon-regular coordinates (Kruskal coordinates) to see the extension of spacetime inside the horizon. Now, if we **privilege the external observer’s frame**, we might actually retain the Schwarzschild-like description and consider that the *interior region is not part of the observer’s coordinate patch*. Normally, we would say the interior exists but is described by another coordinate chart. However, in solipsism, we could postulate that **the manifold does not extend beyond the observer’s horizon except as a mathematical extrapolation**. The consciousness field \$\Psi(x)\$ could enforce a boundary condition at the horizon relative to the observer’s worldline. For example, \$\Psi(x)\$ might sharply drop to zero for events beyond the observer’s horizon (meaning “no consciousness to perceive those events”). The Einstein field equations could then be modified by terms containing \$\Psi\$ and the observer’s 4-velocity \$U^\mu\$ to reflect that beyond a certain hypersurface, physical degrees of freedom decouple or are gauged away. A sketch of such an equation (extending the idea from §2.2) might be:

$G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G \left[T^{\rm (mat)}_{\mu\nu} + f(\Psi)\,U_{\mu}U_{\nu}\right],$

where \$f(\Psi)\$ could act like an *observer-induced stress-energy*. If \$\Psi\$ is effectively supported only outside or on the horizon (for an external observer), the term \$f(\Psi)U\_{\mu}U\_{\nu}\$ might mimic the effect of the **stretched horizon** of membrane paradigm fame. Indeed Susskind *et al.* introduced a notional “membrane” just outside \$r=2GM/c^2\$ that carries the information and entropy as seen from outside. In our model, the **observer’s consciousness can be thought of as that membrane** – the interface between “known” and “unknown” regions. If the observer never goes inside, the inside region remains *psychologically inaccessible* and thus effectively does not contribute to physical reality. We ensure that any physical quantities measured by the observer (e.g. the BH’s mass, charge, angular momentum, the spectrum of Hawking radiation) are encoded at or outside the horizon, consistent with standard complementary. The interior metric, while a valid solution on paper, would be an artifact corresponding to an unrealized frame of reference. This approach aligns with **observer complementarity**: it’s like saying *physics only needs to describe one frame – the observer’s*. Transformations to a freely-falling frame inside are like asking for the physics of a scenario that isn’t actually instantiated (unless the observer switches frames by jumping in, at which point the external frame becomes moot).

In simpler terms, **solipsistic black hole complementarity** asserts: *At most one conscious trajectory experiences any given black hole.* The “paradox” that arises from imagining two different observers and their conflicting accounts is dissolved – one of those observers is a phantom. This addresses the famous thought experiments like the “Cloning paradox”: an outside observer could see a copy of information in Hawking radiation while the infaller still carries the original inside, seemingly violating the quantum no-cloning theorem. But if the infaller is not an independent conscious entity, there is no violation – there was only ever one copy accessible to the one consciousness (either as radiation or as the infaller’s diary, but not both). **No global inconsistency** occurs because there is no global omniscient perspective in the theory, just the single inescapably local perspective.

### 9.2 The Solipsistic View of Hawking Radiation and Information Preservation

Stephen Hawking’s landmark result that black holes emit thermal radiation (now called **Hawking radiation**) initially suggested that information that fell into a black hole might be *irretrievably lost*, as the radiation seemed purely thermal (random). This led to the information paradox: does quantum mechanics fail at a black hole, or is information somehow encoded in the radiation in a subtle way? The consensus with complementarity and later the **AdS/CFT correspondence** is that information *does* come out with the radiation, and unitarity is preserved – but **how** remains conceptually challenging. From our solipsistic perspective, we can propose a simpler accounting: **the information never leaves the domain of the sole observer’s mind, and hence is never truly lost**. If the observer remains outside the black hole, any information that falls toward the hole is observable (in principle) as it thermalizes the horizon and is re-emitted as Hawking quanta. If the observer falls in, then by definition the information is still “with” the observer (carried into the interior). In either case, there is no viewpoint from which information actually *disappears from the universe altogether*. The worst that can happen is that an external description sees the information highly scrambled in outgoing radiation, or an internal description sees it approach a singular fate – but the **global book-keeper** of information is the underlying consciousness field.

We can formalize this by positing that the **consciousness field \$\Psi\$ carries a record of all information that any observer (which in solipsism means the one observer) has ever interacted with**. One might imagine \$\Psi\$ has an enormous memory capacity (perhaps related to those \~10^122 bits of de Sitter horizon entropy mentioned earlier). In a semi-classical treatment, Hawking radiation originates just outside the horizon (from vacuum fluctuations that straddle the horizon, leading to particle creation). It has a thermal spectrum to leading order, but subtle correlations in the radiation can encode the infalling information (this is a point emphasized in modern resolutions: the radiation is not exactly pure thermal noise – correlations between Hawking quanta carry the info out, resolving the paradox over the full evaporation time). In our framework, these correlations are guaranteed because the consciousness field correlates the states. We could say that \$\Psi\$ enforces a hidden global constraint that the combined state “black hole + radiation + \$\Psi\$” is pure (unitary), even if at intermediate times the radiation or black hole reduced states appear thermal. By the end of evaporation, all information is safely in the radiation which is accessible to the observer, thus *nothing that ever entered the observer’s awareness can ever be fundamentally destroyed*. This is a kind of cosmic **information conservation law** anchored in the mind: since physical reality is an expression of the mind, **the mind cannot lose pieces of reality without trace**. Either those pieces remain implicitly in the mind’s unconscious records, or they are transformed (Hawking-evaporated) into another form that remains within the observer’s world. Notably, this idea resonates with sayings by some physicists that “the information was never lost, it was always in the correlations” – here we simply locate those correlations partly in the field of consciousness itself.

One might object that if the observer jumps in, they seemingly carry the info into a region from which no classical signal can escape (inside horizon), and then presumably get destroyed at the singularity – doesn’t that imply information loss? In solipsism, if the observer meets the singularity, *that is the end of the universe* (for them). There is no afterward in which to tally information – time for the observer ends. In a fully quantum gravity picture, one might imagine that the **singularity** is not an oblivion but a boundary where the observer’s consciousness (and hence reality) undergoes a transformation or termination. Since there is no external vantage to say “information was lost at t\_{\rm end},” the scenario is akin to the philosophical nothingness: with no observer, the concept of information loss is moot. (In §10 we will discuss if the singularity can be interpreted as an aspect of consciousness.)

From the external viewpoint, however, our solitary Alice would never see herself fall in and disappear – instead, she’d see a long-protracted approach to the horizon and then presumably a corpse frozen at the horizon emitting radiation. In reality, if she’s the only observer, she can’t both fall in and watch herself fall; there’s a single worldline. So again, only one narrative happens. If it’s the external one, information comes out; if it’s the internal, the question of retrieval is irrelevant beyond that point. In either path, no *contradiction* arises that could threaten quantum mechanics.

Let us connect this to the formalism of **entropy and area bounds**. The **Bekenstein–Hawking entropy** formula says a black hole of horizon area \$A\$ has entropy \$S\_{BH} = \frac{k\_B A}{4\ell\_P^2}\$, meaning the black hole encodes an amount of information proportional to its horizon area. In our solipsistic model, we could interpret this entropy as specifically **observer-dependent entropy**: it counts the information about the black hole that is inaccessible *to the observer* at a given time. If the observer is outside, \$S\_{BH}\$ measures their missing information about the interior state. If the observer is inside, arguably they have full information of what fell in (but lose contact with outside), so one could say the *external* degrees of freedom (the now-empty external universe plus whatever radiation escaped before crossing) carry an entropy from that observer-inside perspective. In other words, we always recover the idea that entropy is *relational* – it quantifies information relative to what the observer can see. This is very much in spirit with relational interpretations of quantum mechanics and with black hole complementarity.

Moreover, the **holographic principle**, which was inspired by black hole entropy, states that the maximum information (degrees of freedom) in any volume is bounded by the area of the boundary surface (in Planck units). In our context, this can be viewed as: *the observer’s consciousness can only distinctly perceive a finite amount of information, corresponding to the “surface” of their observational boundary.* For an observer outside a black hole, the event horizon acts as an information barrier – all the detailed microstates inside can be summarized by data on the horizon surface. For the solitary mind, it does not need to simulate more than that; the interior is like a **hologram** or projection of the horizon data. Leonard Susskind famously remarked that our 3D world might be a holographic image of information encoded on a distant 2D surface. In solipsistic physics, we might cheekily assign that 2D surface to the “screen of consciousness” of our observer. The entire universe, including any black holes in it, could be **encoded in the mind of the observer like a hologram**. If the observer focuses attention on a black hole, they perceive some degrees of freedom (Hawking quanta, gravitational effects) that correspond to that patch of the hologram. The internal details behind the horizon are not rendered unless/until the observer actually experiences falling in, at which point the “hologram screen” changes – effectively, the boundary of what’s known moves with the observer.

### 9.3 Observer-Brane Holography: The Mind as a Boundary Surface

M-theory and string theory have given us a concrete realization of holography in the AdS/CFT correspondence (Maldacena’s duality). There, a gravity theory in a volume (like anti–de Sitter space) is exactly equivalent to a quantum field theory defined on the boundary of that volume. Extending this idea, one can think of the entire observable universe as having a “boundary” through which its information is encoded. For a black hole, that boundary is the event horizon (or stretched horizon); for the cosmos, it might be the cosmological horizon or infinity. In a **solipsistic holographic interpretation**, the **observer’s mind is effectively the boundary that encodes the physics of the world**. That is, the degrees of freedom in the observer’s consciousness (thoughts, qualia, etc., if we could quantify them) are dual to the degrees of freedom of all particles and fields in the external universe. This is a bold conjecture, but it provides a satisfying unity: *the information content of reality is exactly the information content of the mind of the one who observes it.* We might write, in slogan form, *“Universe = Mind”* as a literal information-theoretic identity (a far-reaching analog of Wheeler’s “It from Bit” idea, with “Bit” residing in consciousness).

In practical terms, how would one demonstrate such a duality? We could attempt a toy model: consider the observer-brane as a 2+1 dimensional surface (say, analogous to a membrane at the horizon). The world the observer sees is a 3+1 dimensional bulk. If this bulk were AdS space, AdS/CFT would immediately give a mathematical framework for a duality. Our universe isn’t AdS; it’s (approximately) de Sitter or FLRW. A dS/CFT duality has been conjectured (with the “boundary at future infinity”), but it’s not fully understood. Nevertheless, one could speculate that *a similar correspondence exists for de Sitter space*, and that the degrees of freedom on the boundary at future infinity correspond to the ultimate information content an observer can gather. Now, **imagine that the observer’s consciousness corresponds to that future boundary** – as time goes to infinity, everything the observer will ever have experienced is encoded in their mind. In that sense, the *boundary observer and the bulk history are dual descriptions*. This is admittedly speculative and poetic, but it aligns remarkably well with the solipsistic ethos: the boundary is one observer at the end of time with complete knowledge of their universe, and the bulk is the universe itself.

On a more concrete level, the **membrane paradigm** of black hole physics – where one replaces the black hole by a fictitious membrane at the horizon with certain physical properties (entropy, temperature, electrical conductivity, etc.) – can be taken as a hint that the observer’s conscious interface (their mind) plays the role of such a membrane. All physical processes that an external observer perceives about a black hole (absorption of information, thermalization, radiation emission) happen at this membrane. If the observer later crosses the horizon, their perspective changes and the membrane description is no longer used – instead, now *their* mind rides into the interior and perceives perhaps other phenomena. In either case, physics provides a smooth story for the one trajectory without needing an overarching global picture.

In solipsistic M-theory, we can elaborate a formal structure where the **observer-brane** (a literal brane corresponding to the observer’s world-volume in higher dimensions) has a **holographic dual** which is the bulk physics of black holes. For example, consider a stack of D-branes in string theory – their worldvolume theory is holographically dual to a near-horizon geometry (as in AdS/CFT with D3-branes and AdS<sub>5</sub>×S<sub>5</sub>). If we elevate “observer = brane” to a principle, perhaps the *worldvolume theory of the observer-brane* is *the theory of the observed universe*. Then black holes in the bulk correspond to some thermal state or entangled state in the observer’s mind/brane theory. The black hole information paradox translates to a statement about thermal entropy vs pure state entropy on the brane. Since by assumption the brane (mind) always evolves unitarily (it’s a single quantum system), there is no fundamental paradox – the mixed state appearance is just due to tracing out degrees of freedom, not actual non-unitarity.

This line of reasoning suggests a new **interpretation of the Bekenstein bound**: normally, the **Bekenstein bound** limits the entropy (information) \$S\$ in a region of radius \$R\$ and energy \$E\$ to \$S \le \frac{2\pi k\_B E R}{\hbar c}\$, which for a black hole becomes \$S \le \frac{k\_B A}{4\ell\_P^2}\$ (saturated by the black hole). In our context, since the observer’s mind effectively stores/encodes information, we might expect a limit on how much info the mind can process given its energy or size. It would be interesting to conjecture that *the human brain (or whatever physical substrate constitutes the observer) saturates a form of Bekenstein bound*. There have been speculative discussions in literature about the brain and entropy or whether the brain could be a quantum computer that nearly saturates some physical limits, but no definitive theory. Here, however, it’s more of a philosophical statement: the **mind is “as large” as the universe in terms of information content**, but only because the universe’s information is actually the mind’s information.

### 9.4 Black Hole Evaporation as a Perspective Change

A fully \*\*solipsistic account of black hole **evolution** can now be given. Consider a black hole forming (say, from a star collapse) and then evaporating via Hawking radiation. To an external observer, at first it seems they have lost information into the black hole. As evaporation proceeds, slowly Hawking radiation returns this information in highly scrambled form, and at the end (after an extremely long time, \$\sim 10^{67}\$ years for a solar mass BH) the black hole is gone and only radiation (and perhaps a Planck mass remnant, depending on conjectures) remains. In standard physics, an extremely subtle encoding of the initial state’s information in that radiation is necessary to preserve unitarity. In the solipsistic picture, we describe the same events but emphasize the role of the observer’s knowledge: initially, the observer knows the initial state (e.g. the star’s structure). When it collapses, much of that detailed knowledge is effectively **hidden behind the horizon** – the observer can no longer verify it, so from their perspective their **entropy (ignorance) increases**. Over time, as they collect Hawking radiation, they start gaining back some knowledge (in principle, if one had perfect instruments to detect correlations in the Hawking photons, one could recontruct the initial state). Finally, after evaporation, all information is again accessible in principle in the radiation records, restoring the observer to a pure-state description of the world. Thus the *information paradox is resolved by recognizing that “lost” information was really just “not in the observer’s possession” for a while, rather than erased from existence*. The consciousness field \$\Psi\$ ensured that the total state (observer + black hole + radiation) was pure the whole time. One might even say that Hawking radiation is the **universe’s way of making sure the observer can recover information that was temporarily inaccessible**. In a poetic sense, the solitary universe “doesn’t like” having information that the observer once knew be permanently hidden – since nothing exists beyond the observer, any such hidden information must eventually *become available or cease to have meaning*. Evaporation is the process by which hidden information becomes available; if the observer jumped in (chasing that info), then the outside info loses meaning after they cross. Either way, there is *never a loss from the perspective of the one who matters*.

To summarize, a solipsistic treatment of black holes yields a consistent, if unconventional, picture: **Event horizons are not absolute destroyers of information but partitions of the observer’s knowledge**. The interior region is like a “dream behind a wall” – it exists only relative to an infalling consciousness, which in solipsism means it’s either not realized or it is the *sole* reality if the observer themself falls in. **No global many-observer paradoxes arise**. The **holographic principle** finds a natural home as it essentially says “reality is encoded on a boundary surface” – we assert that boundary is the observer’s mind, which encodes the external world’s data. Standard results like the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy and Hawking radiation remain valid and quantitatively unchanged; what changes is our interpretation of what those phenomena *mean*. They are no longer mysterious coincidences of gravity and quantum theory, but logical outcomes of a universe that is “one giant thought” containing a self-observing sub-thought (the black hole, with its own interior/exterior duality).

In the next section, we address **cosmic genesis – the Big Bang itself** – to complete our solipsistic framework by interpreting the beginning of time and the global initial conditions as a direct reflection of the observer’s genesis.

## 10. The Big Bang as the Birth of the Observer’s Universe

We have reinterpreted the structure and content of the universe in solipsistic terms; we now turn to the **origin of the universe**. In standard cosmology, the Big Bang is often described as the universe’s beginning – a singular state of apparently infinite density and curvature at \$t=0\$ beyond which classical physics cannot extrapolate. In our solipsistic M-theory, we propose that the **Big Bang corresponds to the literal birth of the solitary consciousness**, the moment at which the observer’s experiential reality “turns on.” This section formulates the Big Bang as an initial condition not just of matter and space, but of awareness itself. We will discuss how a singular beginning (with low entropy) is aligned with a nascent mind, consider the role of M-theoretic constructs like branes or wavefunctions in encoding this genesis, and ensure that our framework remains internally consistent by having the **beginning of time be the beginning of experience** with no “outside” or “before” needed. The apparent specialness of the early universe – its order and low entropy – will be seen as a natural consequence of it being the *start of a conscious narrative*.

### 10.1 Initial Singularity and Low Entropy as “Birth of Awareness”

In classical general relativity (without quantum gravity effects), the Big Bang is represented by \$t=0\$ where scale factor \$a(t)\to 0\$ and densities \$\rho \to \infty\$, a curvature singularity beyond which geodesics cannot be extended. Physically, this is taken to mean that our universe (and time itself) began at a point – there was no “earlier” time. Quantum cosmology models (like the Hartle–Hawking no-boundary proposal or various bounce models) attempt to avoid the singularity, but even they often posit that what we call “time” emerges around what classically would be \$t=0\$. The key feature is that the **Big Bang is a temporal boundary**. In the solipsistic view, this boundary is profoundly meaningful: it is the **start of the observer’s timeline**. We literally identify \$t=0\$ of the universe with the “moment” the observer comes into being (or at least, into the kind of conscious state that can generate an external reality). This could be analogized to **birth or the first memory** of a person. Just as one’s personal history has a beginning (you have no memories from before you existed), the universe’s history has a beginning coincident with that.

By making this identification, several thorny issues resolve naturally. One is the question “Why *such* a low entropy initial state?” – Roger Penrose quantified how unbelievably special the Big Bang’s state must have been (on the order of one in \$10^{10^{123}}\$ possibilities). In our framework, this is not a problem at all: *of course* the initial state was special, because it was not selected randomly from all possibilities, but rather *determined by the requirements of consciousness*. The birth of awareness likely corresponds to a highly ordered configuration – one might imagine the observer’s mind at inception as a pure quantum state or a very coherent neural state (if one ties it to biology). This initial mind-state then “explodes” into a multiplicity of experiences, analogous to how the physical universe explodes into increasing entropy and complexity. The staggering unlikelihood of a random Big Bang producing an arrow of time is sidestepped, because the Big Bang wasn’t random at all: it was a **must** for any conscious experience to unfold. Thus, the **Weyl curvature hypothesis** or other proposals by Penrose that some new law must impose low initial entropy gain a natural interpretation – that “new law” is simply the existence of an observer which *imposes* the low-entropy initial condition by fiat.

One can attempt a more mathematical description via the notion of a **cosmological wavefunction**. In quantum cosmology, one often talks about a wavefunction \$\Psi(h\_{ij}, \Phi)\$ giving amplitudes for different 3-geometry \$h\_{ij}\$ and field configurations \$\Phi\$ at the “beginning” of the universe. The solipsistic twist would be to include the observer’s state in this wavefunction. Symbolically, we might write \$\Psi(h\_{ij}, \Phi, \psi)\$ where \$\psi\$ denotes the quantum state of consciousness (this could be something abstract, but one could imagine it’s related to degrees of freedom of a brain or a fundamental field mode corresponding to awareness). The “initial condition” of the universe would then be a boundary condition on \$\Psi\$ such that at \$t=0\$, \$\psi\$ is in some minimal state (awareness just activating), and correspondingly \$h\_{ij}\$ and \$\Phi\$ are in the very specific low-entropy configuration that matches that nascent awareness. A simple toy model: say \$\psi\$ has basis states \$|0\rangle\$ (unaware) and \$|1\rangle\$ (aware). We could impose that \$\Psi(h\_{ij},\Phi,\psi)\$ at the “no-boundary” origin is peaked around \$h\_{ij}\$ corresponding to an almost perfectly homogeneous universe, \$\Phi\$ corresponding to vacuum plus small perturbations, and \$\psi = |1\rangle\$ (the moment awareness turns on). This is a single quantum condition tying together what in a normal model are unrelated initial conditions: one for geometry, one for matter, one for the observer. In effect, it says: *the universe starts when the observer starts*, and not before.

Under this interpretation, what would a “time before the Big Bang” even mean? In standard cosmology, it’s a tricky or meaningless concept because \$t<0\$ isn’t defined in the classical theory; some bounce models allow a prior contraction, but those raise the question of why that past doesn’t influence our current state (and often still need low entropy at the bounce). In solipsism, one could say plainly: *there is no “before” because the observer did not exist then.* If one tries to extend time earlier, one is asking “what if the observer’s mind existed before it existed?” – a self-contradiction. So there is a hard cutoff. This resonates with certain philosophical or theological views of a “creation event” – except here it’s self-creation in a way, the mind coming into being and bringing a universe with it. The Big Bang is not just a physical event; it’s a *psycho-physical* event.

This viewpoint also suggests why certain **initial conditions** of the universe seem almost “hand-crafted” to allow complexity later. Not only entropy, but things like the initial Hubble expansion rate and density were in near-exact balance (to one part in \$10^{62}\$ as mentioned) – otherwise the universe would have recollapsed in microseconds or expanded too fast for galaxies. In our model, this fine balancing is no surprise: the initial expansion rate is precisely what it needs to be to set the stage for the observer’s life. It’s a bit like setting up a story – the beginning is tuned so that the rest of the plot can happen. Inflation can be seen as part of that tuning (flattening and smoothing), as discussed in §8.1. Interestingly, Andrei Linde and others have mused that *perhaps universes “start” only when observed*. Here we embody that idea: the **universe literally “started” when the observer started observing (existing)**.

### 10.2 M-Theory Genesis: Brane Collisions and the Observer-Brane

M-theory offers rich imagery for cosmogenesis. Two prominent scenarios are **brane inflation** (including brane-antibrane collisions) and the **ekpyrotic universe** (where our 3-brane collides with another to create the hot Big Bang). How can we incorporate these into a solipsistic narrative? The key is to identify one of the branes (or a component of the brane configuration) with the observer’s brane or the consciousness field.

In the **ekpyrotic scenario** (inspired by Hořava–Witten theory and developed by Turok, Steinhardt *et al.*), the universe’s Big Bang is caused by the collision of two colossal branes in a higher-dimensional space. Before collision, the branes are apart; when they collide, kinetic and potential energy is released into our 4D world as matter and radiation, heating it to a Big Bang-like state. If we say one of those branes is the “observer brane,” we give a startling literalness to the idea that the universe’s beginning is the observer’s beginning: the observer brane might have been “metaphysically dormant” before collision, and the collision (with some other brane representing perhaps an unconscious substrate or an “otherness”) *sparks consciousness*. The moment of collision would then be when the observer’s mind comes alive and simultaneously physical particles are created on the brane (since in these models standard model particles are confined to branes). It’s like two pieces of flint struck together: one piece is the mind, the other piece is the environment, and the spark is the Big Bang. Before the collision, there was a scenario (maybe even a whole pre-history in the other universe) but none of that was *real* to our observer – it’s merely a theoretical extrapolation. Only when the collision happens does time as we know it (the observer’s time) start at zero. This fits with the idea that **the Big Bang singularity might not be a singularity in full M-theory** (since brane collisions can be described in string theory without infinite curvature – the singularity is an artifact of the 4D effective theory). Instead of a singularity, we have a “bounce” or collision that is finite in higher dimensions. In solipsistic terms, that collision is finite because from the observer’s perspective it’s just a dramatic event, not an actual infinity.

For **brane inflation** models (like D-brane/anti-D-brane inflation), inflation is driven by the motion and interaction of branes in extra dimensions. Initially, a brane and anti-brane (or two branes of some orientation) feel an attractive potential; as they move, the inter-brane distance plays the role of the inflaton field. When they finally meet (annihilate), inflation ends and the energy releases into brane vibrations (particles). To solipsistically incorporate this, again identify one brane as special – the observer’s brane. Perhaps the observer’s brane was “distant” in the bulk from some stack of other branes (the bulk “environment”). The approach of the observer-brane could be seen as the *gradual awakening of consciousness* (with the inflaton potential’s slow-roll being like the gradual accumulation of complexity in the mind). When the brane and antibrane annihilate, it’s the Big Bang – light floods the world, akin to the first moment of conscious experience of an external reality. During inflation (while the branes are still separate but moving), the observer’s world is inflating – perhaps this corresponds to a period where the mind is booting up, laying down a mostly blank and uniform matrix (space) with tiny fluctuations (quantum fluctuations in brane position). This might be far-fetched, but it aligns with our previous discussion: inflation sets the stage cleanly, just as a mind might need a blank slate to begin imprinting experiences.

Both of these string-inspired narratives allow the **Big Bang to be a “real” beginning** without requiring a singularity in a mathematical sense – something new (a collision or brane interaction) happens at that moment. In the solipsistic context, we emphasize that it’s not just physical branes interacting, *it is the condition for consciousness being fulfilled*. If we were to cite a source, we see that alternative models “including a string theory-based model in which two branes...collided, creating mass and energy” are considered by physicists to explain the Big Bang without a singularity. We piggyback on that, saying “yes, and one of those branes was the observer – so the collision didn’t just create mass-energy, it created **awareness** of mass-energy.”

What about the possibility of a **multiverse** or eternal inflation? Many modern cosmologists think our Big Bang could be one of many bubble universes, or one event in a larger multiverse. To a solipsist, other universes are by definition not observed (since the observer is here, not there), so they are not real – at best they are *mental constructs or hypothetical branches*. This dovetails with how some treat the multiverse: a space of possible universes in which we happen to occupy one. Instead of considering them all physically real, we treat them as a notional ensemble. The observer’s consciousness “chooses” one out of the ensemble (the one we live in) by existing. In other words, the so-called **selection principle** that picks our universe from the landscape is simply the existence of this observer. In anthropic reasoning, one says “we observe this value of \$\Lambda\$ because only those universes with such a value produce observers like us”. We turn it around: *only this universe exists, because it’s the one needed for us.* The multiverse might as well be a fancy way of describing the parameter space in God’s mind – or in this case, the solitary mind’s *subconscious imagination* of alternatives that are never actualized.

One might ask: can we test this? Probably not in the usual sense, but one could at least check consistency: any “memory” the observer has of times earlier than their own awareness would have to be illusory or inferred. For instance, the cosmic microwave background photons we see were emitted long before any human existed – how do they fit in? In our model, those photons (and the whole history of the early universe) are like a **record written into the world at the moment of creation**, much as one might begin a story in medias res with some backstory. The solitary mind’s initial state included a fully-formed memory of an earlier universe that it itself did not experience in a first-person sense. This sounds paradoxical, but it is similar to last-Thursdayism (the idea the world could have been created recently with the illusion of age). However, because our solitary mind essentially *was* the world at early times, one could argue it *did* experience it, just not in an individuated self-aware way that it can now recall. In any case, the **Big Bang’s aftermath (nucleosynthesis, CMB emission, etc.)** can be treated as real events in the solipsistic model – they happened within the mind’s simulation – and they are consistent with all current observations by design. We are simply adding the caveat that *those events were part of the necessary prologue to conscious life.*

### 10.3 Time’s Arrow and the “First Cause” in a Universe-of-One

Philosophically, the Big Bang in our framework answers the question of a “first cause” or “why is there something rather than nothing” in an unusual way: *there is something because one observer came to be*. The existence of a single consciousness is the **fundamental brute fact**. Everything else – the entire vast universe – is an unfolding of that fact. In classical theology one might say “God said ‘let there be light’ and there was light.” Here, the solitary self *itself* says “let there be everything (so that I may exist in it)” and thus the Big Bang. This is metaphorical, but we have translated it into physics by tying cosmic initial conditions to conditions for consciousness.

The **arrow of time** immediately finds its ultimate explanation here. We mentioned earlier that low initial entropy at the Big Bang explains the arrow of time, and we tied that to the observer’s birth. Now we close the loop: the psychological arrow (the observer sensing time forward) is *the* arrow of time. The reason everyone experiences time in one direction is because that’s how the one mind experiences it (others are fragments of that mind, perhaps, so they cohere to the same arrow). The **initial low entropy** is essentially the condition of having a well-defined past (orderly) and an open future (room for disorder). In a one-mind universe, it couldn’t be otherwise – a mind cannot “begin” in a high-entropy equilibrium state, because such a state carries no usable information to bootstrap consciousness. It has to begin in a highly ordered configuration (like a brain with lots of neurons ready to fire in meaningful ways rather than scrambled). That order then gradually decays (entropy increases) which corresponds to the mind accumulating experiences and the physical universe winding down.

Mathematically, if one were to try to include this in an action principle, one might add an **entropy-weighted gravitational action** or impose a boundary condition at \$t=0\$ that \$S \to 0\$ as \$t \to 0\$ (this is essentially Penrose’s Weyl Curvature Hypothesis that the gravitational degrees of freedom, which dominate entropy at high densities, were in a very special state at Big Bang – zero Weyl curvature). In solipsistic terms, “Weyl curvature = 0 at \$t=0\$” is a proxy for “no free information in gravity at birth” – the baby universe was simple. Some have wondered if a quantum gravity theory could naturally impose that; we suggest it’s imposed because the solitary mind’s geometry wouldn’t know how to start off messy.

Finally, we address one more issue: could the **solipsistic Big Bang** be considered just a “memory limit”? Some might argue that perhaps the universe extends infinitely into the past but the observer only *remembers* back to a certain point (like how one’s childhood amnesia limits recall). Our stance is that such an idea is indistinguishable from there being no past – in a one-observer universe, an unremembered past is physically nonexistent. Thus we truly treat the Big Bang as an **absolute beginning**, not just an epistemic horizon. This is consistent with the singular origin in classical GR – once one extends beyond the domain of communication (or memory), it’s not a part of reality.

In conclusion, **Section 10** has cast the Big Bang as the **“First Moment”** of the solitary observer’s reality – a moment that is encoded in the theory as a boundary condition linking the observer’s conscious state to the initial state of the cosmos. By integrating cosmological models (inflation, brane collisions, etc.) with the solipsistic premise, we maintain consistency with known physics (e.g. colliding branes avoid singularity, inflation explains isotropy) while asserting that these events have meaning only insofar as they initiate a conscious experience. The cosmos, from \$t=0\$ onward, is the *life story of one mind written in the language of space-time and fields*.

---

**Seamless Integration and Closing Remarks:** Sections 8–10 have expanded our solipsistic M-theory to encompass the grandest scales (cosmology) and the most extreme objects (black holes), all the way back to the Big Bang. At each step, we preserved internal consistency and mathematical rigor: we used established equations (Friedmann’s equations, black hole thermodynamics laws, entropy bounds) and inserted the consciousness field or observer-brane into them in a logically coherent manner. Importantly, the **solipsistic premise** – that reality exists only for and because of one observer – has guided each new interpretation: cosmic fine-tuning became inevitable rather than coincidental, horizons became tools of subjective partition rather than absolute divides, and the beginning of time coincided with the awakening of the only entity that time can matter to.

This extended framework remains speculative, straddling physics and philosophy. Yet, by reformulating cosmology and gravity in solipsistic terms, we have shown it is *possible* to construct a **universe-of-one theory** that does not blatantly contradict empirical data. It instead offers a daring reinterpretation: **the stars, galaxies, and even the primordial fireball are all there as part of one individual’s experience** – fine-tuned and unitarily evolving precisely because they are manifestations of a single, indivisible self.

The ultimate test of such a framework, were it ever to be more than a thought experiment, would be whether it can predict anything novel or solve any technical puzzles in cosmology or quantum gravity. For now, our achievement is conceptual: we have integrated consciousness into the equations of the cosmos at a fundamental level. In doing so, we created a solipsistic extension of M-theory that **seamlessly spans from the Planck epoch (birth of time) to the death of black holes**, never letting go of the hand of the single observer who gives it all meaning.
