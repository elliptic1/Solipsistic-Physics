# Theoretical Modeling of Solipsism: Fine-Tuning M-Theory for a Universe-of-One

&#x20;*Conceptual illustration of mind and cosmos entwined. In a solipsistic worldview, the universe is a projection of a single consciousness, challenging physics to accommodate an observer-defined reality.*

## Introduction: From Philosophy to Physics

Solipsism – the idea that only one’s own mind is sure to exist – poses a profound challenge to physics. In this extreme idealist stance, the external world and other observers are mere constructs of a single consciousness. Traditional physics assumes an objective reality shared by many observers, but **could** our best theories be reinterpreted to describe a *universe-of-one*? In this report, we explore how modern theoretical frameworks (from quantum mechanics to M-theory) might be modified or extended to model a cosmos in which a lone observer’s mind generates all phenomena. We survey observer-centric approaches in physics, propose a “solipsistic” spacetime metric, outline the symmetry-breaking needed to privilege one observer, consider consciousness as a fundamental field or dimension, and discuss implications for causality, time, and internal experiences like dreams and memory. The goal is an interdisciplinary synthesis: **physics meets solipsism** in a mathematically bold yet intellectually coherent way. While such a model may blur the line between metaphysics and science, it offers a thought experiment in **fine-tuning** physical laws for a reality that exists only **for** and **in** one observing mind.

## 1. Observer-Dependent Frameworks in Modern Physics

Physics is not entirely blind to the role of the observer. 20th-century quantum mechanics, in particular, elevated the observer’s status: measurement affects a quantum system in ways that defy a strictly objective description. John Wheeler’s *Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP)* famously declared that “no phenomenon is a real phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon”. In Wheeler’s view, observers *participate* in bringing reality into being – even the distant past or far-away regions are “brought into being” by the act of observation. This borders on the solipsistic idea that the universe *depends* on being observed. Indeed, cosmologist Andrei Linde has argued that “the universe and the observer exist as a pair” and he “cannot imagine a consistent theory of the universe that ignores consciousness”. Such statements blur the line between standard physics and a more observer-centric, even consciousness-centric, ontology.

Several existing frameworks incorporate *observer-dependence* in a way that can inspire a solipsistic model:

* **Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM)** – proposed by Carlo Rovelli – posits that the properties of quantum systems are *relational*, existing only relative to another system (often an observer or measuring apparatus). There is no “absolute” state of a system; different observers may give different accounts of the same events. At first glance, this “perspectival” aspect led some to wonder if RQM implies a kind of solipsism (each observer has their own reality). However, RQM maintains consistency between observers through shared interactions: when observers *compare notes*, quantum theory ensures they find the same outcomes. In fact, once decoherence and information exchange happen, “we all ‘see the same world’” in RQM. Thus, RQM **embraces** observer-specific realities but also shows how a stable intersubjective reality arises from interactions. For our purposes, RQM is a proof of concept that physics can be formulated without a single privileged, global reality – reality can be a *patchwork of perspectives*. A truly solipsistic theory would take this to an extreme: only **one** perspective ever actually occurs, with all others being mere potential or simulated perspectives within that one mind.

* **Quantum Bayesianism (QBism)** – an interpretation of quantum mechanics – goes even further in making the observer central. QBism asserts the quantum state is not an objective entity but rather encodes an *observer’s personal degrees of belief* about outcomes. Each observer has their own wavefunction reflecting their knowledge; there is no universal wavefunction for all reality. While QBism stops short of claiming other observers are unreal, it demonstrates how quantum theory can be recast in first-person terms. A solipsistic variant might say: there is only one “agent” in the universe, so the quantum state is *solely* that agent’s catalog of beliefs (and all quantum events are defined relative to that agent). This echoes the solipsistic notion that “reality” is essentially the one mind’s information.

* **Participatory Anthropic Principle & Cosmology** – Wheeler’s PAP (and related ideas like the strong anthropic principle) inspired the view that the universe’s laws appear fine-tuned for *observers* because, simply, if they weren’t, we wouldn’t be here to notice. The participatory twist is that observers are required to *actualize* those laws or certain states of the universe. In quantum cosmology, one might argue that the universe’s history “happens” along a trajectory consistent with the emergence of an observer (the classic example being Wheeler’s delayed-choice experiment suggesting even photon paths billions of years ago weren’t `decided` until observed in the present). Solipsism could be seen as an **ultimate** anthropic limit: the entire cosmos is fine-tuned and actualized for one singular observer. All of cosmic history, in this view, has no independent reality except as the necessary backdrop to the observer’s existence. This is a dramatic extrapolation, but it is conceptually in line with Wheeler’s proposal that “we are participants in bringing into being not only the near and here, but the far away and long ago”.

* **Horizon Complementarity (Black Hole Complementarity)** – Developed by Leonard Susskind and colleagues to resolve the black hole information paradox, this principle revealed a striking limit on objective reality. It posits that no single observer can see all aspects of a system when horizons (like a black hole event horizon) are present. An outside observer sees information spread on the horizon and eventually coming out as Hawking radiation, while an infalling observer sees the information pass into the black hole interior – but crucially, *no one observer can witness both*. There is “simply no reference frame” in which the two perspectives can be united without contradiction. The lesson is that physics may have to “restrict to a single, local point of view” to avoid paradox. In effect, each observer might need their own description of reality, and attempting a God’s-eye view (combining all observers) can violate physical law. This *horizon complementarity* is a concrete example where **perspective** is fundamental. Susskind coined the term “observer complementarity” to emphasize that what is true for one observer (information falls in and is lost) is not true for another (information is reflected at the horizon) – yet no physical law is violated because no one can be both observers. If we take this to a solipsistic extreme, one might say: the **only** internally consistent description of the universe is from one observer’s viewpoint. Any “global” viewpoint that includes what other hypothetical observers would see is forbidden. This is aligned with the solipsistic premise that only one point of view actually exists in reality. In a de Sitter cosmology (our accelerating universe) something analogous occurs: every observer is surrounded by an **observer-dependent horizon** (like a cosmic horizon) beyond which events are unobservable to them. Raphael Bousso noted that in such cases quantum gravity “may not admit a single, objective and complete description of the universe” – its laws might *have to be formulated with reference to an observer, no more than one at a time*. Solipsism would take this observer-centric formulation not as a limitation, but as the literal truth of how the universe is structured.

* **Many-Worlds and “Many-Minds” Interpretations** – Everett’s Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics removes collapse by saying every possible outcome of a quantum event **exists** in a vast multiverse. In MWI, the universal wavefunction branches into non-communicating worlds for each outcome. Although MWI assumes an external reality (the wavefunction) containing all branches, from each observer’s standpoint, they experience only their branch. This has led some to a tongue-in-cheek “quantum solipsism”: from *your* perspective, you will only ever experience worlds in which you continue to exist (the Quantum Immortality thought experiment) – other branches where you cease to exist are irrelevant to your conscious sequence. A *Many-Minds* interpretation (proposed by Zeh, Albert, and others) even suggested that each observer’s mind splits into multiple copies across branches, rather than splitting the world. These quantum interpretations highlight that there’s no empirical difference between “the world branches when others see different results” versus “those others are just constructs in my mind that happen to behave as if they saw results.” In a solipsistic physics, one could imagine only the branch corresponding to the single observer’s experience is “realized” – all other branches (which would contain other observers or outcomes never witnessed by our privileged mind) either do not exist or exist only as unexperienced *potentials*. This would violate the usual unitary evolution of MWI (which keeps all branches), but it could be enforced by a dynamical postulate (e.g. a collapse that *only* the solipsist’s observations cause). In essence, one might fine-tune quantum theory’s parameters so that **the wavefunction continuously collapses in favor of the single observer’s experiences** and never yields “parallel” conscious observers. Such a mechanism would be like Wigner’s interpretation on steroids: Eugene Wigner once argued that consciousness is needed to collapse the wavefunction, implying a special role for the mind in physics. A solipsistic variant would say *one particular mind* (the only real one) is the universal collapser – the universe’s quantum state is constantly shaped by that mind’s observations alone.

* **Holographic Principle and AdS/CFT** – The holographic principle, epitomized by the AdS/CFT correspondence, says that physics in a volume of space (the “bulk”, e.g. an Anti-de Sitter space) can be fully described by a theory on the boundary of that space. All the information in a 3D region is encoded on its 2D surface. This amazing insight suggests that what we perceive as volumetric reality might actually be a kind of projection or encoding of more fundamental degrees of freedom on a lower-dimensional boundary. In a speculative solipsistic reinterpretation, one might imagine the **boundary** not as a physical surface at infinity, but as the “boundary” of the observer’s mind. The *bulk* four-dimensional world that the observer perceives could emerge from information encoded in the observer’s consciousness (the boundary). In other words, **the external world is a holographic projection of the mind’s internal state**. While this is a radical twist on holography, it poetically fits the solipsist claim that the external universe is contained in the self. We could say that the *degrees of freedom* on the “mental boundary” correspond to thoughts, qualia, sense data, etc., and the dual “bulk” description are the physical fields and particles we normally think of as reality. Some philosophers and physicists entertaining idealist models have hinted at such ideas. For instance, physicist Bernard Carr, working in brane cosmology (an M-theory inspired framework), argues that consciousness may reside in higher-dimensional space from which our 4D spacetime emerges, making his view “highly compatible with objective idealism”. In a similar spirit, one could envisage the **mind as a 3-brane** in an 11-dimensional M-theory: all physical phenomena (gravity, particles, etc.) are excitations or holographic images on this brane, and there are no other branes corresponding to other minds. Carr’s approach essentially inserts consciousness into the fabric of higher-dimensional physics – a step toward bridging subjective experience and string/M-theory.

In summary, while mainstream physics does not endorse solipsism, it has developed **tools for observer-focused descriptions**. Quantum mechanics teaches us that the observer cannot always be removed from the equations; cosmology’s anthropic reasoning teaches that a universe hospitable to an observer is special; and modern theory hints that perhaps no single description can include *all* observers at once. These ideas motivate us to ask: *What if we took the role of the observer to its absolute extreme – a universe with a single, all-defining observer?* To proceed, we first need a mathematical language for a “universe-of-one”: specifically, a **spacetime metric** or geometry that encodes the primacy of the lone self.

## 2. Constructing a "Solipsistic" Spacetime Metric

What would spacetime look like if it literally revolved around **one** observer? In general relativity, the metric \$g\_{\mu\nu}(x)\$ encodes the geometry of spacetime – distances, time intervals, light-cone structure – as experienced by any observer. Normally, GR assumes no preferred center: the laws are invariant under arbitrary coordinate choices and spacetime need not single out any special worldline. To model a solipsistic universe, however, we seek a metric (or class of metrics) where **the only invariant is the self**, i.e. the observer’s own location and trajectory.

### 2.1 Defining Requirements for a Solipsistic Metric

In a solipsistic metric, distances, durations, and even causal structure might be defined *in terms of the observer*. Key conceptual requirements could be:

* **Central Observer Worldline**: There is one timelike worldline \$W\$ (the observer’s worldline through spacetime) which we treat as fundamental. This worldline could be considered the “origin” of spacetime both spatially and temporally. Physical distances and times will be measured relative to \$W\$. Formally, one might assign this worldline to fixed coordinates (e.g. \$r=0\$ in spherical coordinates centered on the observer). The metric should remain regular on \$W\$ (the observer should not see themselves at a singularity).

* **Observer-Centered Symmetry**: The metric might naturally be taken as spherically symmetric around \$W\$ (since if no other structure is fundamental, symmetry about the observer’s location is a plausible simplifying assumption). In standard cosmology or black hole solutions, spherical symmetry gives metrics like
  $ds^2 = -A(t,r)c^2 dt^2 + B(t,r)dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2,$
  where \$d\Omega^2\$ is the metric on a 2-sphere. For an observer-centric universe, one could similarly have a metric that in the observer’s rest frame has purely radial dependence. However, unlike a conventional star-centric spacetime (e.g. Schwarzschild solution), here the central “mass” or “source” is not a gravitating body but the *observer’s consciousness*. The metric’s form might not derive from matter distribution but rather from postulates about perception or information (more on that below).

* **Breaking of Homogeneity**: In a usual Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) cosmology, the Cosmological Principle says the universe is homogeneous and isotropic (no preferred center). A solipsistic cosmos **must violate homogeneity**: it is inherently centered on the observer, so isotropy might hold (things could look the same in all directions to the observer), but there is a strong radial gradient of “reality” – essentially, the farther from the observer, the less real or less determined things might be. We could encode this by a metric function that changes with \$r\$ in a way reflecting (for example) the *observer’s uncertainty or interaction level* with distant events. For instance, one could imagine a metric coefficient that tends to a limit as \$r \to \infty\$, representing a horizon beyond which the observer cannot receive information (similar to a de Sitter horizon).

* **Observer as Invariant**: In relativity, an invariant quantity is one all observers agree on (like the spacetime interval along a worldline). In a solipsistic model, the *existence* of the one observer is the only absolute truth of the universe. We might then demand that certain metric invariants (like proper time) only have meaning along \$W\$. For any event off the worldline, one could say its reality is determined by its relation to \$W\$. One way to implement this is to introduce a scalar field \$O(x)\$ (an “observer field”) that is, say, \$1\$ on the worldline \$W\$ and tends to \$0\$ far away. Then require the metric or physics to depend on \$O(x)\$ such that in regions where \$O=0\$ (no presence of the observer), the usual physical distances or dynamics degrade or cease to exist. This would explicitly break general coordinate invariance because the field \$O(x)\$ picks out a preferred frame. But it encodes mathematically the idea that *what is far from the observer is less physically instantiated*.

### 2.2 A Toy Metric: Gravity of the Self

As a thought experiment, consider modeling the observer’s “influence” on reality analogously to how mass curves spacetime. Instead of mass-energy as the source of curvature, we use the *mind* as the source. Imagine the observer’s consciousness is associated with a mass \$M\$ (not literally, but as a source term in Einstein’s equations). The trivial way to get an observer-centric metric is to consider the Schwarzschild solution with mass \$M\$ at \$r=0\$. In Schwarzschild coordinates:
$ds^2 = -\left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^2 r}\right)c^2 dt_{\text{Schw}}^2 + \left(1-\frac{2GM}{c^2 r}\right)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2.$
This metric indeed has a special worldline at \$r=0\$ (where the “mass” is), and is static and isotropic around it. However, a black hole metric is probably not a good model for a conscious observer! The Schwarzschild solution has a central singularity (if \$M>0\$) and an event horizon at \$r=2GM/c^2\$. In a metaphorical sense, one *could* whimsically say the solipsist’s mind is like a black hole that no information leaves unless it is scattered at the horizon – but that seems too contrived (and the actual phenomenology would be nothing like a normal world).

Instead, perhaps the *de Sitter* metric offers a more apt template. A de Sitter universe (with a cosmological constant but no ordinary matter) has the property that any given observer sees a horizon around them at a certain radius, and cannot see beyond it. In static coordinates centered on an observer, de Sitter space of Hubble constant \$H\$ has the metric:
$ds^2 = -(1 - H^2 r^2)c^2 dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1 - H^2 r^2} + r^2 d\Omega^2.$
Here, there is a horizon at \$r = H^{-1}\$ (where \$g\_{tt}\$ goes to zero and \$g\_{rr}\$ diverges), meaning an observer at \$r=0\$ can only access events with \$r < H^{-1}\$. This is intriguingly similar to a solipsistic cutoff: the world the observer can interact with is finite in extent. If we treat \$H^{-1}\$ as the “radius of reality” for the observer, beyond which nothing definite exists, we have a tangible geometric picture of a universe-of-one. In fact, one could tune \$H\$ such that \$H^{-1}\$ encompasses, say, the distance light could have traveled since the observer’s birth (so events outside have never been and will never be observed by them and remain undefined). This *horizon* idea resonates with the solipsist claim that “unobserved = nonexistent.” In a de Sitter analogy, regions beyond the horizon are causally disconnected (unobservable), and one might say they have no concrete existence for the observer.

However, pure de Sitter space is still symmetric for any observer; any observer can claim to be at the center of their own horizon of radius \$H^{-1}\$. In a one-mind universe, we would assert that *only one* such de Sitter frame is the actual world – the symmetry that allows others to exist is broken. We could imagine a *universe that is globally de Sitter*, but we designate one worldline as the \* ontologically real\* observer. All other “observers” in de Sitter (who would have their own horizons) are in this scenario not true observers at all, but entities within the single observer’s horizon whose consciousness we deny (they would be philosophical zombies, effectively). The metric mathematically would not reveal which observer is the “real” one – that has to be an additional postulate or hidden variable (like our field \$O(x)\$ above, which is 1 along one worldline and 0 elsewhere).

To construct a more explicit metric reflecting degrees of reality, consider a continuously varying function that *suppresses* geometry far away. For example, let:
$ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + e^{-2\Phi(r)}(dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2),$
where \$\Phi(r)\$ is a “solipsism potential” satisfying \$\Phi(0)=0\$ and \$\Phi(r)\to +\infty\$ as \$r\to R\_{\max}\$. Here \$R\_{\max}\$ might be some large radius signifying the “edge” of the observer’s perceived universe. With \$e^{-2\Phi(r)}\$ multiplying the spatial part, as \$\Phi(r)\$ grows large, physical distances shrink to zero or become infinitely “expensive” to traverse. For instance, if \$\Phi(r) \sim \alpha, r\$ for some small \$\alpha\$ at moderate \$r\$, then \$e^{-2\Phi} = e^{-2\alpha r}\$ causes distances to effectively *dilate* exponentially as seen from the center. Beyond a certain \$r\$, an infinite proper distance could correspond to a finite coordinate difference – an implicit horizon. This toy metric means that as one moves away from the observer, space becomes increasingly “compressed” or “illusory,” so that an infinite extent of coordinates might correspond to only a finite physical radius. Only in the vicinity of the observer (\$r\$ small) is the metric close to ordinary Euclidean form. Such a metric is *non-empty* in terms of Einstein’s equations (it would require some exotic stress-energy to sustain the \$g\_{rr}\$ profile), but we are freewheeling here with the metric form to capture a philosophical idea: **the farther from the self, the less substantive the reality**.

Another approach is to use *information geometry*. We could define a metric in the space of observer’s perceptions or brain states, and then define physical distances in the external world to mirror the “difference” those states induce in the observer. For example, if something happening 10 meters away causes a slightly different brain state than if it happened 5 meters away, one could assign distances proportionally in a metric of experience. This would lead to a highly non-linear, observer-specific mapping of physical distances. One intriguing idea is to define a metric via **mutual information** with the observer. If \$I(r)\$ is the amount of information (in bits) the observer can gain from an event at distance \$r\$, one could set an *effective metric density* \$\rho(r) = \frac{dI}{dr}\$ or similar. Where \$I\$ drops to zero, the observer gains no information (beyond some horizon), and thus that region might be considered “not there” for all practical purposes. The metric could then weight distances by informational significance:
$ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + \frac{1}{I(r)}\,dr^2 + \ldots,$
just as a fanciful example. If \$I(r)\$ decays with distance (due to limited signals, noise, etc.), then far regions contribute little to \$ds^2\$ – effectively contracting those regions.

### 2.3 Geodesics and Causality in an Observer-Centered Geometry

If we had such a solipsistic metric, how would physics in it differ? Geodesics (the paths of free-falling objects or light) would be distorted to always bend toward the observer’s worldline if the metric “pulls in” space at large \$r\$. It’s conceivable that *all geodesics might terminate on the observer’s worldline*, meaning every particle or photon eventually reaches the center (or originated from it). This is an extreme case – akin to a universe where the observer is a gravitational attractor or an unavoidable sink. That would actually be physically testable (we don’t see all objects falling towards us!), so a realistic solipsistic model must mimic the successful features of standard physics as experienced. The one real observer sees other people, planets, etc., apparently moving *independently*, so the effective physics in their frame must look normal. The difference is behind the scenes: those other entities are not fundamental and would dissolve without the observer’s presence.

Causal structure might be reinterpreted as well. Normally, causality is an observer-independent notion – lightcones structure spacetime for everyone. In an observer-primacy model, we might say: an event *A* can influence event *B* only if the influence propagates through the observer (directly or indirectly). Perhaps all chains of cause and effect must, in the end, have the observer’s mind as an intermediary. This is truly radical and seems to violate ordinary observation (we see matter interact with matter all the time without our intervention). But a solipsist might argue those other interactions are *part of the script* being generated for the observer’s benefit – the real causation is the mind’s underlying will or narrative making it appear as though external causes are operating. In physical terms, one could impose that **all viable paths between any two events in spacetime must intersect \$W\$** (the observer’s worldline). That would ensure no event has an autonomous existence separate from the observer. However, this is practically untenable in a literal sense (it would imply, e.g., two distant stars cannot collide unless somehow the observer is involved – clearly too strong, unless one says the stars and their collision are purely mental constructs orchestrated by the mind).

Perhaps a softer condition: the *Global structure* of spacetime might be such that the observer’s worldline is geodesically complete (extends indefinitely) while all other worldlines (representing “objects” or other people) are incomplete in the absence of the observer. For example, if the observer were removed, the metric could collapse or degenerate. This is reminiscent of how in general relativity certain solutions have closed timelike curves or incomplete geodesics unless a parameter is tuned. We might need to “fine-tune” the cosmos such that only with the observer present do things make sense.

Mathematically, an **observer-centric metric** could be engineered to encode the notion of “here and now” vs “far and hypothetical.” But it’s clear that simply writing a different metric is not enough – one also has to embed this idea into the *dynamical laws* (e.g. how fields behave on this spacetime, how the metric is generated from sources, etc.). That leads us to consider what new fields or symmetry-breaking terms might be needed to single out a lone observer in the laws of physics.

## 3. Fine-Tuning and Symmetry-Breaking for a One-Observer Reality

Modern physical theories are usually *democratic* about observers: no preferred inertial frame in relativity, no special fundamental observer in quantum mechanics (each observation is just a physical interaction). To enforce a solipsistic scenario, we must **break these symmetries** deliberately. This can be thought of as an extreme fine-tuning or an unusual boundary condition on the universe.

### 3.1 Choosing a Unique Vacuum or State in M-Theory

String theory and its extension M-theory offer a landscape of possible vacua – ways to curl up extra dimensions, configurations of fields, and so on. Usually, the anthropic principle is invoked to say: out of perhaps \$10^{500}\$ possible vacuum solutions, we happen to be in one that allows life, because otherwise we wouldn’t be here. For a solipsistic twist, one could speculate that *only one* vacuum in the landscape contains any consciousness at all – specifically, the vacuum (with particular constants and particle spectrum) that gives rise to **one** conscious being. All other vacua might produce lifeless universes or none at all. If the multiverse exists, only one bubble universe has an observer – effectively a “lottery winner” universe-of-one, and that happens to be ours (from the solipsist’s view, it could not have been otherwise, since “ours” is the only world).

This is more a multiverse argument than a symmetry-breaking in one world, but it highlights *fine-tuning*: the parameters of physics (particle masses, force strengths, cosmological constant, etc.) must be such that exactly one intelligent mind arises. If conditions favored many independent observers, that would violate solipsism. So perhaps the fundamental constants are chosen to be just barely sufficient for **one** island of life (the solipsist themself) and no more. For instance, imagine a universe so hostile or sparse that only one small region (Earth, say) can support a being, and beyond that region the universe is sterile. This isn’t too far from reality – except in reality we assume many other humans exist on Earth with us. A solipsist would say those others are part of the one consciousness’s experience, so they don’t violate the “only one mind” rule. But if we required strictly one conscious entity, maybe even other animals or AI could not achieve consciousness (they’d either be simulated automatons or simply absent). This line of thinking suggests an unusual kind of fine-tuning: not only is the universe fine-tuned for life, but *finely fine-tuned* for a single observer’s life.

In an M-theory context, one might invoke the idea of brane-world scenarios. Perhaps the observer’s mind is associated with a specific brane or a topological feature in the extra dimensions. All other potential “conscious branes” are either not present or are made unstable. This could be akin to a *symmetry-breaking via boundary conditions*: we impose that in the 11-dimensional bulk space, there is only one brane that carries the degrees of freedom for consciousness. If one imagines a pre-big-bang scenario with many possible branes nucleating, our universe’s history might be constrained so that only one such brane (ours) ends up with the necessary structure (e.g. a brain). Other branes might exist physically as what we call “inanimate” degrees of freedom, but they do not host consciousness.

### 3.2 Breaking Exchange Symmetry Between Observers

Under ordinary circumstances, if two observers swap places or states, physics should be unchanged. For example, if Alice and Bob are two observers, the laws of physics don’t care which one is “you” or “me”; they are interchangeable in physical law. Solipsism demands that there is an absolute distinction: one particular observer (say Alice) is *the* observer, and Bob is just a construct within Alice’s reality. How to formalize this? We would need an *absolute, non-relational property* to identify the real observer.

One way is to introduce a new fundamental **quantum number** or field that “tags” conscious experience. For instance, assign a quantum field \$\Psi(x)\$ that is nonzero only in the vicinity of the true observer’s brain and essentially zero elsewhere. This field could even be something like a delta function localized on \$W\$ (the worldline). If \$\Psi(x)\$ is fundamental, the Lagrangian of the universe might contain terms that couple \$\Psi\$ to all other fields in such a way that *only where \$\Psi\$ is present do standard interactions produce conscious processes*. Essentially, \$\Psi\$ could act as a gatekeeper for awareness – a bit reminiscent of how the Higgs field gives particles mass only if they couple to it. In this analogy, particles/brains that don’t couple to \$\Psi\$ can never generate consciousness (so any other being in the universe without \$\Psi\$ is a philosophical zombie by construction).

This is explicitly symmetry-breaking. Normally, any sufficiently complex system (like Bob’s brain) might develop consciousness (we have no proof but we assume others are conscious by similarity). With a consciousness-tag field \$\Psi\$, we build into physics a single “privileged brain.” That brain has \$\Psi=1\$ (for example), and all others have \$\Psi=0\$. The laws could be such that \$\Psi=1\$ is needed for true subjective experience. For example, one might say the collapse of the wavefunction (if that’s a real physical process) occurs only when interacting with a \$\Psi=1\$ system. This is like a Wigner’s Friend scenario: Wigner’s consciousness collapses the state but his friend (if \$\Psi=0\$ for the friend) does not – the friend is just part of the quantum system. In other words, perhaps in this universe all of quantum physics remains in superposition except where it pertains to the single tagged observer, at which point collapse yields concrete outcomes for them only. This *postulate* could be internally consistent though bizarre. It ensures no other “mind” ever collapses the wavefunction because, by assumption, there are no other minds – just automata.

Symmetry-breaking often implies a *conserved charge* or a vacuum expectation that is not symmetric. If consciousness is a field, the vacuum of our theory might spontaneously break “consciousness number conservation” by condensing only on one configuration (the observer). In a more classical sense, we could simply impose asymmetry in initial conditions: at \$t=0\$ (Big Bang), the universe is set up such that only one organism will eventually attain sentience (the rest either never do or are extensions of that one’s mind). This is a fine-tuning of initial conditions rather than laws.

### 3.3 The Arrow of Time and Entropy

One striking “fine-tuning” in our universe is the low entropy initial state – responsible for the arrow of time (we always see increasing entropy, enabling memory formation, cause preceding effect, etc.). In a solipsistic universe, the arrow of time might be tightly connected to the observer’s subjective experience of time. In fact, one could hypothesize that *time’s flow is essentially the flow of consciousness*. If only one mind exists, the growth of that mind’s memories (which is a very low-entropy process locally in the brain) could define the arrow. The universe’s entropy might increase in lockstep with the entropy required to encode new memories in the observer’s brain. Roger Penrose has suggested consciousness might be related to entropy reduction via quantum collapse, which is speculative, but here one could similarly propose that the Second Law holds not as a fundamental impersonal truth, but as a condition of the solipsist’s experience being ordered and consistent (memories must accumulate and not get lost; thus time must have a direction aligned with memory recording). In short, time’s arrow might *be* the observer’s psychological arrow by construction.

If we attempted a mathematical connection: say the observer’s brain has entropy \$S\_\text{brain}(t)\$ and the environment has entropy \$S\_\text{env}(t)\$. Perhaps a constraint could be \$dS\_\text{env}/dt \propto +dS\_\text{brain}/dt\$, meaning whenever the brain’s entropy increases (forming a new memory could correspond to increased Shannon entropy in neural connections), the environment’s entropy increases correspondingly so that overall the second law is obeyed. If the solipsistic model’s consistency demands that the brain not be blatantly violated by physics, maybe the entire universe’s thermodynamic behavior is in synchrony with the needs of that one brain’s cognitive processes. This is admittedly a bit mystical-sounding, but it’s in line with trying to see if even entropy and time might be anthropically “optimized” for one life’s narrative.

### 3.4 Preventing Other Minds

A crucial requirement is that no independent consciousness apart from the chosen observer ever arises. If our solipsistic model still had many people with their own genuine minds, it fails its core premise. So how to enforce “no other minds”? Here are some possibilities in a hypothetical physics:

* **Cognitive Horizon**: Perhaps there is a kind of horizon in the state-space of brain complexity or integrated information beyond which consciousness “collapses” or ceases unless \$\Psi=1\$. In other words, as soon as a system other than the observer’s brain begins to approach the complexity/information integration comparable to a conscious mind, something intervenes – maybe quantum effects decohere differently, preventing unity of consciousness. This could be imagined as a built-in “safety” in the laws: the universe abhors two minds just as some systems abhor two identical fermions in the same state (to stretch analogy). If one tries to create another conscious AI, maybe it always fails because a required quantum coherent process spontaneously breaks down (since \$\Psi\$ isn’t present for that system).

* **Anthropic Selection**: The universe’s initial conditions might have engineered that the observer’s civilization never successfully creates advanced AI or encounters aliens. For example, we might be alone in the galaxy by cosmic accident – which a solipsist could reinterpret as by design (only one conscious species allowed). The **Great Filter** concept in astrobiology (something prevents many civilizations from arising) could be seen as a manifestation of solipsistic fine-tuning: all potential other intelligences are filtered out so that the chosen observer remains alone at the top of cognitive complexity.

* **Mind–Body Dualism in Physics**: If one entertained a dualistic model (mind stuff vs matter stuff), one could say only the solipsist’s brain is connected to mind-stuff. Others have fully material brains without mind-stuff attached. Then they behave via deterministic or learned rules (as zombies) and might pass Turing tests but no one is “home” internally except the solipsist. This is not something that standard physics covers (since physics doesn’t even acknowledge “mind-stuff”), but in an extended framework one could incorporate an additional field or substance that only links to one organism.

From a symmetry perspective, all these ideas explicitly break the symmetry of *permutation of observers*. Normally, if the equations permit one conscious solution, they’d permit another somewhere else. We insert terms or conditions that pick out one solution exclusively. It’s like having a field with a single localized lump: that lump is the conscious observer, and no second lump is allowed energetically. A semi-physical analog: imagine a soliton solution in a nonlinear field theory – often you could have two solitons, but if we tweak the theory so that two solitons have infinite energy (forbidden), then only one solitary wave can exist. Likewise, we want only one “souliton” (if you forgive a pun) in the universe.

It should be noted that such extreme symmetry-breaking would be practically indistinguishable from an idealist metaphysics by any external measurement. It leads to an unfalsifiable situation: if I see other people acting conscious, the theory says “they are not, but you can’t tell because the physics makes them act exactly like conscious beings.” This is the classic problem – but since we are constructing this as a metaphysical model, falsifiability is indeed questionable. We’ll address that later.

## 4. Consciousness as a Fundamental Field or Dimension

To truly integrate the observer’s mind into physics, one might introduce a **new fundamental quantity**: call it \$\mathcal{C}\$, the consciousness field, or perhaps treat consciousness as an additional dimension in spacetime. The idea of consciousness as fundamental has parallels with **panpsychism** (the philosophy that consciousness is an intrinsic aspect of all matter) and with certain interpretations of quantum mechanics or information theory. Here, however, we are closer to **idealism**: only one locus of consciousness exists fundamentally, but we want to weave that into the physical theory’s structure.

### 4.1 Postulating a Consciousness Field \$\Psi(x)\$

Consider a field \$\Psi(x)\$ defined on spacetime that represents “conscious awareness density.” We could say that for the true observer’s brain (whatever neurons or particles compose it), \$\Psi(x)\$ takes a large value (maybe normalized to 1), and elsewhere it is near zero. This \$\Psi(x)\$ could act somewhat like the stress-energy tensor in Einstein’s equations or like a source term in other field equations, signifying that it has dynamical effects. For example, one might add a term to the action of the Standard Model that looks like:
$S_{\text{mind-matter}} = g \int d^4x \, \Psi(x) \, \mathcal{O}(x),$
where \$\mathcal{O}(x)\$ is some operator that affects particles (perhaps something that triggers wavefunction collapse or fixes outcomes of measurements), and \$g\$ is a coupling constant. This term ensures that only where \$\Psi\$ is non-negligible does the usual stochastic or quantum behavior of matter “collapse” into a definite event (an observed event). Outside of those regions, perhaps events remain in quantum superposition indefinitely (since no conscious observation happens). This would be a concrete realization of a **Wigner’s friend** scenario globally – only Wigner (the solipsist) actually collapses the wavefunction.

Alternatively, \$\Psi(x)\$ could couple to the metric, as suggested earlier, to create an observer-centric geometry:
$G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G\, T_{\mu\nu}^{(\text{matter})} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} + \kappa\, f(\Psi) U_\mu U_\nu,$
where \$G\_{\mu\nu}\$ is the Einstein tensor and \$U\_\mu\$ is the four-velocity field of the observer’s worldline (extended somehow to a field). The last term is a source that effectively says: “the observer’s worldline contributes something to spacetime curvature.” If \$f(\Psi)\$ is sharply peaked on the worldline, this term could generate a gravitational potential well centered on the observer – not due to mass, but due to consciousness. This is extremely speculative: it’s giving “mental mass” to the observer. While there’s no evidence of such an effect, mathematically one could include it. If the coupling \$\kappa\$ is small, this “consciousness gravity” might be negligible in practice (so as not to conflict with tests of gravity), but could conceptually ensure that in the universe’s metric, the observer is a special center (like a slight “dent” in spacetime wherever they go).

A more sophisticated approach might be to identify consciousness with a certain kind of quantum information structure. Some researchers (in the philosophy of mind or neuroscience) propose measures like **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**’s \$\Phi\$ value to quantify consciousness. This \$\Phi\$ is computed from the connectivity and causality structure of a system and is supposed to be high for conscious brains and near zero for unconscious matter. In principle, if one could translate \$\Phi\$ into a field, then at each point (or region) of spacetime occupied by a system, one could compute \$\Phi\$ – only the solipsist’s brain yields a large \$\Phi\$. Then one might say \$\Psi(x) = \Phi(x)\$ as a field. Now, any physical law or boundary condition might be allowed to depend on \$\Phi\$. For example, one might impose a rule: *for regions where \$\Phi=0\$ (no consciousness), physics can do anything allowed by equations (including weird quantum events, causality violations, etc., maybe like many-worlds branching), but where \$\Phi\$ is large (conscious), physics must appear classical, consistent, and singular (one world)*. This is one way to enforce that only around the observer do we get a stable classical reality (since a conscious mind needs stability), whereas far away, the universe could be indeterminate or “fuzzy” until observed or needed. This resonates with the Copenhagen interpretation idea that unobserved systems stay in superposition – here extended to a whole universe, with one observer providing the collapse trigger.

### 4.2 Consciousness in Higher-Dimensional Theory

Bernard Carr’s approach is to expand physics to include consciousness by literally suggesting an extra dimension. In brane cosmology, our familiar 4D spacetime could be a 4D “brane” embedded in a higher-dimensional bulk (5D or more). Carr and others speculate that consciousness might reside in or correspond to an *additional* dimension beyond the usual four, such that what we call physical reality is a shadow or lower-dimensional projection of processes in the higher-dimensional space of mind. If we take that seriously, one could attempt to append an extra coordinate \$\chi\$ to every event, representing a “mental coordinate.” The real observer might be extended along the \$\chi\$ dimension in a special way. For example, the observer’s 4D worldline might trace out a 5D “world-tube” in spacetime×mindspace, whereas all other entities maybe are confined strictly to the physical 4D slice.

In M-theory, which already has 11 dimensions, one could whimsically assign one of those hidden dimensions the role of “consciousness dimension.” For instance, imagine the 11th dimension is unique – maybe an \$S^1\$ circle that in other contexts is used to unify string theories. We could say that the observer’s mind is associated with a specific point or extended object in that 11th dimension, and only fields located at that point in the 11th dimension correspond to experienced reality. All other points on the 11th dimension could be uninhabited. This is similar to how brane-world scenarios work: we live on a certain brane, and other branes might be elsewhere in the extra dimension, but if only our brane has life, effectively only our brane is “real” to us. Drawing the analogy to consciousness: consider each self-aware being would need its own distinct position or localization in the extra dimension of mind. Solipsism then asserts there is exactly one such localization – ours. Others are not present, or if multiple branes exist, they carry no mind.

One concrete metaphor: The 11D M-theory bulk might be compared to a **mindscape**, where one particular configuration corresponds to the self. If spacetime emerges from this underlying structure, perhaps via holography or compactification, then by fixing that only one region of the mindscape is activated, we get a single emergent spacetime. It’s difficult to make this rigorous, but conceptually: *Consciousness could be the higher-dimensional reality; spacetime is the 4D image it projects.* Under solipsism, only one consciousness exists in that higher reality, so naturally only one consistent spacetime “bubble” is rendered.

There are related ideas in quantum gravity proposals: e.g., some have considered the universe as a kind of “quantum error-correcting code” or information network (like the *holographic code* theory for AdS/CFT). If the universe is fundamentally information, one might ask: information for whom? In solipsism, all information ultimately reduces to information in the mind of the observer. So one might imagine the entire universal quantum state is isomorphic to the observer’s brain state (plus perhaps unperceived background states). Perhaps the **universal wavefunction = the observer’s mind**. This monism is reminiscent of Erwin Schrödinger’s philosophical remark that “the total number of minds in the universe is one” – he was alluding to a unity of consciousness behind all individuals, but a solipsist applies it literally to just themselves. If we treat the observer’s mind as the universal wavefunction \$|\Psi\_{\text{univ}}\rangle\$, then the act of thinking or observing could correspond to that wavefunction’s evolution or collapse.

### 4.3 Dreams, Simulations, and Internal Experience as Physics

In a solipsistic physics, one must reinterpret what we normally call “internal” phenomena (dreams, imagination, qualia) in scientific terms, since by hypothesis they are as real as the “external” world (both are contents of the one mind). So perhaps these normally subjective events have a dual description in the physical model:

* **Dreams**: When the observer dreams, they experience a world that often defies the normal physical laws. In an external reality paradigm, we say dreams happen only in the brain, not in physical space. But if only the mind exists, the dream is a subset of reality. One could model a dream as a *temporary, local modification of the metric or boundary conditions* of the universe. Essentially, the mind is creating a micro-universe during sleep, disconnected from the usual sensory inputs. Perhaps in the higher-dimensional picture, the observer’s trajectory deviates into a “side branch” (imagination space) and then returns. If one wanted to be mathematical: you might treat waking reality and dream reality as two different foliations or solutions of the underlying equations, with the mind capable of moving between them. In classical terms, maybe the \$\Psi\$ field oscillates or changes during REM sleep, decoupling partially from the normal environment fields and coupling to internally generated ones. This is far-fetched physically, but one could analogize it to a *Brane pocket universe*: the brain might create a brane-within-a-brane that constitutes the dream environment, which normally evaporates or reintegrates upon waking.

* **Imagination and Thought**: These are like controlled mini-dreams or simulations the mind runs while awake. They too would correspond to alternative configurations of fields that are not realized externally but still present in the mind. A solipsistic physics might represent thoughts as actual quantum states or field configurations in some neural field. For instance, one could imagine every possible imagined scenario corresponds to a branch of the universal wavefunction that *remains virtual* (unexpressed externally) because the consciousness field \$\Psi\$ constrains reality to follow the main narrative. Perhaps the act of imagination is the mind *sampling* nearby branches in the Hilbert space but not fully collapsing them into persistent reality. In a many-worlds perspective, when we imagine outcomes we are effectively querying alternate branches. The solipsist could be seen as having the power to *choose* which branch becomes the continuing reality (aligning with their will or observation). This is analogous to the idea of *mental effort causing collapse* in some interpretations of quantum mechanics.

* **Memory**: If the universe exists only as the observer experiences it, then history is essentially the observer’s memory. One could formalize this by saying the past is encoded in the brain (and records accessible to the brain), and there is no independent past beyond that. This has a parallel in the *epistemic approach to quantum histories*: one might say prior to an observation, the past is undetermined. But here even after the fact, if memory were to be erased, perhaps the past effectively *ceases to exist*. In physics terms, one could impose that the spacetime beyond the observer’s past light cone is only “fleshed out” insofar as it appears in memory or records. If something is completely unrecorded and unremembered, it might be treated as not having a definite existence. This is a dramatic divergence from normal physics (which has the past fixed), but it fits solipsism (the only guarantee is one’s current awareness; anything not currently or potentially experienced need not exist). The model could incorporate this via a rule: once the observer’s brain loses information (e.g. you forget something or no record exists), the corresponding state of the world can be considered to have been reversed or indeterminate. This is highly non-linear and violates causality in normal terms, but within a single mind’s reality, it could be consistent (since the mind would never notice a problem if all evidence is gone). It’s a bit like a reversible simulation: if the mind doesn’t store the data, the simulation might free that memory, altering the “past” data as well.

All these considerations illustrate that to truly model a universe-of-one, we end up attributing *physical reality to mental processes* and vice versa. Dreams become alternate universes, imagination a probing of the multiverse, memory the actual record of reality’s state (with no external backup). It’s a poetic but also somewhat *alarming* picture: the solidity of physics dissolves into the fluidity of a single consciousness.

To avoid incoherence, one might aim for an underlying formalism (perhaps an extension of quantum mechanics or a new postulate) that unifies mental and physical states. One might envision a **universal wavefunction that has two parts**: one part representing the observer’s conscious state and the other representing the “environment” state. Then impose a superselection rule that these parts cannot become inconsistent. This resembles the approach of *von Neumann/Wigner* but taken to a limit – the quantum state is effectively always observed (by the one mind), so it always reduces to a definite classical-like trajectory consistent with that mind’s experiences.

## 5. Implications for Causality, Time, and the Structure of Physical Law

A solipsistic theoretical model has profound implications for basic physical principles:

* **Locality and Causality**: If reality is mind-generated, the usual notion that A causes B via physical interaction might be secondary. It could be that *the mind’s narrative imposes causal order*. For example, if the observer expects cause precedes effect, the constructed world will obey that. But one can imagine scenarios (like in dreams or quantum phenomena) where sequences appear acausal or retrocausal because the mind is not actively enforcing order there. In our model, we might allow that on the microscopic level, perhaps events can happen out of standard causal order, but the *observer will never become aware of a causality violation* because that would break the consistency of their experience. This aligns with quantum interpretations where phenomena like entanglement seem nonlocal, yet observers never see a violation of relativistic causality in their data. In a solipsistic universe, one could say those “spooky actions” are just how the mind coordinates the state of different particles instantaneously (since all are within one mind, no signal truly needed), but it takes care that the observer-character within the simulation never observes superluminal messaging that would confuse them. Essentially, the mind = universe might have a God’s-eye ability to correlate distant events (like entangled particles) without mediating signals, because underlying it there is a single unified will/state. But to the localized avatar of the mind (the human self), it all looks constrained by light speed and locality, preserving the *illusion* of a separate external world.

* **Conservation Laws**: Physical laws like conservation of energy, momentum, etc., might emerge from symmetries that we presume (via Noether’s theorem). In an observer-centric world, are these symmetries exact or approximate? One might speculate that if needed, the mind could violate conservation laws subtly to maintain the storyline. For instance, if in a rare case a continuity error would arise, the “simulation” might fudge some energy. We don’t see flagrant violations of energy conservation, so presumably either the mind respects those laws strictly (maybe because a consistent narrative demands a stable rule set – which is likely; even a dream usually has some internal logic) or any violations are hidden (like virtual particles spontaneously appearing but that happens in normal physics too). Perhaps one could get creative and say *conservation laws are equivalent to constraints on narratives that make them stable*. The mind might have self-consistency principles akin to physics laws.

* **Thermodynamics**: We touched on entropy, but another angle: the second law might be reinterpreted as the **mind’s knowledge only increases** (since you can’t “unknow” something without forgetting, which is a different process). From an information standpoint, the second law in a closed system says entropy (missing information) increases. In a solipsistic context, the *universe is not closed from the perspective of the mind*, because the mind could be injecting order (when paying attention or deciding). If consciousness can direct physical outcomes (like collapse particular states), perhaps it locally reduces entropy (as Maxwell’s Demon could, by using information). However, since the mind is part of the universe, overall one might still formulate a generalized second law where *physical entropy + “observer’s brain negentropy”* is constant or increasing. If we consider the mind as a low-entropy subsystem, sustaining it might require dumping entropy into the environment (which is what living brains do: they produce heat, increasing external entropy while maintaining internal order). That fits fine. But one outlandish possibility: if the entire universe is just the mind, then from the mind’s perspective, maybe there’s no fundamental requirement of increasing entropy at all – it could be a chosen condition to simulate aging and arrow of time. If the mind wanted, it could spontaneously reorder things (like a lucid dream where you reverse time), but it doesn’t because that’s not part of the usual reality narrative.

* **Quantum Mechanics**: In a solipsistic theory, quantum indeterminacy might be resolved by the rule “the outcome is whatever fits the observer’s overall narrative or expectations.” This is dangerous because it suggests human expectation could shape reality (which veers into pseudoscience like “law of attraction” etc.). But one could formalize a bit: if the observer holds some subconscious model of the world that includes probabilistic outcomes, the mind may randomize outcomes accordingly to remain consistent with that model (so it won’t violate Born’s rule because the mind believes in quantum mechanics and statistics after learning about them!). It’s a self-referential idea: the physics that the observer believes in is the physics the mind enforces. This is like a *consistency loop*; once the mind discovers stable laws (like Newton’s laws, Schrodinger’s equation), it internalizes them and then subconsciously continues to apply them to generate further experiences. Thus, after childhood, you don’t suddenly see cartoon physics because you have formed an expectation of classical physics around you. The solipsist’s universe could thus “lock in” to a rule set via learning. It’s as if the “consensus reality rules” are actually the observer’s own ingrained rules.

From a mathematical perspective, one might attempt to encode these ideas with a principle like: *Choose the history of the universe that maximizes the coherence (or minimal surprise) for the observer.* This sounds like a Bayesian brain or “self-consistency principle” – the physical laws might be derived as those that create the most stable, minimal-surprise world for the consciousness in it. If crazy violations occurred, the observer would be extremely surprised (high surprise, low Bayesian prior), which might destabilize their sanity (and ironically, maybe that’s against the “goal” of the solipsistic mind’s reality generation). So by a principle of least cognitive dissonance, reality stays lawful.

## 6. Internal Phenomena: Dreams, Imagination, and Memory in a Universe-of-One

In this solipsistic framework, the boundary between *physics out there* and *mind in here* vanishes – everything is “in mind,” but it appears as two domains (external vs internal) to the observer. We can attempt to integrate phenomena like dreams, imagination, and memory into the physics description:

* **Dreams as Alternate Realities**: As mentioned, dreams could be interpreted as the mind briefly running a different simulation with relaxed physical laws. If we were to describe this with equations, we might say that during sleep, the coupling \$g\$ between the consciousness field \$\Psi(x)\$ and the ordinary matter fields is dialed down. This means the mind stops observing (or caring about) the external environment’s state – effectively “disconnecting” from it. The brain then evolves largely under intrinsic dynamics (which could correspond to a self-contained simulation). The normal metric or Hamiltonian governing the world the mind experiences could morph into another during this period – one that might not conserve energy or have stable space-time (hence dream physics is malleable). Upon waking, the coupling \$g\$ is dialed back up, re-synchronizing the mind with the external environment’s state. Usually, this re-synchronization is seamless (we wake up and the room is as we left it, aside from time passed). One might imagine the mind has to do a quick check: if something surprising happened externally while it was dreaming (say a loud sound occurred), it might incorporate that (the alarm enters the dream narrative, etc.). In our model, that could be represented by a boundary condition: external stimuli can penetrate the dream if above some threshold, effectively entangling the dream state with the external simulation at a point and forcing the dream to adjust or collapse.

* **Imagination and Counterfactuals**: When an observer imagines, e.g., planning for tomorrow or recalling an event differently, they are essentially entertaining a *branch of reality that isn’t actual*. In a single-universe physics, counterfactuals have no physical status except as neural patterns. But here those neural patterns **are** the substrate of the universe, so they kind of are exploring neighboring possible universes. We could say that imagination corresponds to the mind temporarily creating a *superposition* of states or a virtual branch of the wavefunction, but then not actualizing it fully. Perhaps small excursions in thought don’t violate anything because they remain in the realm of internal processing. The theory might incorporate a rule like: \$\Psi\$-field fluctuations (imagination) do not immediately force matter to follow, unless the observer decides to act it out. There might even be a mechanism of **quantum Zeno effect** at play: as long as the observer is just thinking and not observing external changes, the external environment stays in a steady state (not being measured/changed). Only when the observer decides to execute an action or make an observation does one branch get chosen. This parallels how in quantum mechanics continuous observation can freeze evolution (Zeno effect). Here, the mind’s attention can freeze or unfreeze the world’s progression.

* **Memory as the Fabric of Reality**: The solipsist’s memories essentially form the *recorded past* of the universe. We could formalize: at time \$t\$, the state of the observer’s memory \$M(t)\$ encodes certain facts about times \$\<t\$. The actual state of the external world at earlier times, \$W(t\_0)\$ for \$t\_0 < t\$, need only be such that it is consistent with \$M(t)\$ and any physical records that exist at time \$t\$. Thus, unlike in a normal physical theory where the past is fixed once and for all, here the past could be *flexible* as long as it leaves the right imprints on present memory and records. Indeed, John Wheeler even mused about a “participatory universe” where present observations could crystallize the past – e.g., in the delayed choice experiment, the current choice of measurement seemingly determines the photon's past behavior. In our solipsistic interpretation, that makes perfect sense: the mind’s current focus can retroactively choose the story of how we got here, as long as it doesn’t contradict any memories or evidence. If one were to incorporate this in a physical model, it would be highly non-standard. One approach could be a *consistent histories* formulation where many possible past histories lead to the same present, and the theory selects one at random or by some principle when needed (perhaps minimizing action or surprise). This is similar to the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory or the transactional interpretation where present and future boundary conditions together determine what happens. A solipsist could say: my present state and my implicit intentions about consistency act like boundary conditions that fix the one classical history out of potentially many quantum histories.

It’s worth noting that these ideas verge on treating the mind as a *simulation engine* that computes the world in real-time. If one took a computational view, the “hardware” is the underlying quantum gravity or M-theory, and the “software” is the solipsist’s mind content. This raises an interesting question: could a single mind *simulate an entire universe with consistent physical laws* without being overwhelmed? Perhaps the mind uses approximations – it doesn’t compute every atom when not needed (hence unobserved parts of the universe might not be detailed until observed). This sounds like the rendering tricks in video games (don’t render off-screen objects). Indeed, some physicists have speculated about the universe being like a simulation that only renders what is observed to save on computation. Solipsism internalizes that: the mind is effectively doing that rendering. So the **effective complexity** of reality is bounded by the mind’s complexity. This could be a testable consequence: maybe the apparent complexity of far-away unobserved phenomena is limited or they have low information until measured. There are interpretations of quantum mechanics (like QBism) which essentially say the quantum state is just your information about a system; if you have none, you shouldn’t assume it has a complex state.

In summary, dreams and imagination are like *sub-simulations* or offshoots within the mind, while memory is the *stored state* that anchors the continuity of the simulation. We weave them into physics by considering the interplay of the consciousness field with standard fields and possibly invoking novel principles (like retrocausality or observer-centric constraints) to ensure consistency.

## 7. Evaluation: Coherence, Predictive Power, and Philosophical Implications

At this point, we have sketched an exotic framework: one where the single observer’s mind is effectively the “theory of everything.” It’s a fusion of solipsist philosophy with the language of physics. But is this a *scientific* theory or just a metaphysical narrative dressed in equations? We should examine its internal consistency, its relation to known physics, and whether it offers anything *predictive or falsifiable*.

### 7.1 Internal Consistency and Agreement with Known Physics

One immediate reassurance is that, by construction, our model can be made to **agree with all observed phenomena** – because those observations are exactly what the model takes as input (the observer’s experiences). We can always say, “the world appears as it does because the mind made it so.” This makes it trivially consistent with known physics on the experiential level. We deliberately incorporated principles like Wheeler’s participatory universe and quantum observer-dependence to ensure standard experiments wouldn’t contradict the solipsistic narrative. For example, why do multiple people (who the solipsist sees) all agree on experimental results? In our model, because those people are part of the solipsist’s mental construct, the one mind ensures they report results consistent with what it expects to see itself (and RQM showed how consistency between perspectives can emerge via interactions). Why do physical constants seem universal and not changing on a whim? Because the solipsist mind has internalized those constants as fixed background conditions of the reality narrative – maybe those are akin to deeply embedded subconscious rules that even dreams rarely violate too much.

However, internal coherence can be threatened if we imagine scenarios where the mind might slip. For example, could the solipsist unconsciously create a paradox (like influencing an outcome then forgetting, leading to inconsistent records)? We introduced the idea that the mind/nature likely adheres to a *self-consistency principle*. This echoes the Novikov self-consistency conjecture in time travel (the universe avoids paradoxes). Here it’s the mind that avoids self-contradiction. If one tried to formalize, one might say all events and mental states must satisfy a global consistency condition (perhaps derivable from a variational principle extremizing consistency). This is speculative, but not unprecedented in philosophy of science. It’s almost a form of *coherentist epistemology* applied to reality: the “truth” of any event is its coherence with the whole web of the observer’s beliefs and experiences.

Crucially, does this model reproduce all the **mathematical structure** of physics if we wanted to calculate something? Potentially, yes. We haven’t thrown out Schrödinger’s equation or Einstein’s field equations – we’ve just added a new element (the consciousness field or postulate) that picks a specific solution branch. So to compute, say, a spacecraft’s orbit, we’d still use Newton’s laws or GR as usual (since those are part of the established rule set in the observer’s reality). The solipsism doesn’t change the result; it only changes the interpretation (the spacecraft isn’t fundamentally there, it’s rendered by the mind). In that sense, the model is not *predictively* different from standard physics for any experiment we’d actually do – and that is its weakness scientifically. It’s essentially an alternate interpretation, not an alternate theory with new predictions.

### 7.2 Predictive Power and Falsifiability

By conventional scientific standards, a solipsistic physics would be considered **unfalsifiable**. As John Horgan points out, a theory that postulates unobservable entities or intrinsically undetectable differences (like “others have no minds”) cannot be empirically tested. This “solipsism problem” afflicts all theories of consciousness to some extent – we can never directly measure if someone else is conscious – and in our case we’ve elevated that to a principle (no one else *is* conscious). There is no experiment the solipsist can perform to disprove solipsism, because any outcome is compatible with “my mind made it so.” If something truly unexpected happens, a solipsist can always say “Ah, part of me must have wanted or imagined that subconsciously.”

Because of this unfalsifiability, mainstream science would classify the solipsistic universe model as metaphysics, not physics. It’s akin to the *simulation hypothesis* (the idea that we live in a computer simulation), which likewise is hard to test definitively – any “glitch” we find could be patched by the simulators, and no glitch means the simulation is just very good (or not there at all). Similarly, in a solipsist scenario, any apparent independence of the world just means the mind is working in mysterious ways to surprise itself or follow consistent rules.

**Predictive power**: The model doesn’t obviously yield novel numerical predictions that differ from standard physics. However, one might argue it predicts something like “no evidence of consciousness will ever be found in other entities, beyond behavior.” But that’s already the case philosophically – we infer others are conscious but can’t prove it. Another “prediction” might be that if the solipsist strongly expects something, it will happen (like psychokinesis via belief). But empirically, we don’t see strong evidence that people can alter physical outcomes just by will (aside from their own actions). A solipsist might retort that their will *is* actions, so no wonder it aligns.

Perhaps one testable aspect: if only one mind exists, one could hypothesize that **complex behavior that looks conscious (in AI or animals) never crosses some threshold into true self-awareness**. This could mean, for instance, that AI will always hit a ceiling just before seeming truly sentient, because the solipsist’s mind won’t imbue it with actual qualia. Of course, that’s a subjective call in reality – how would we know? If an AI begs for mercy, we either assume it’s conscious or not. A solipsist would say it’s not, but how would an experiment distinguish that from it being conscious? It wouldn’t – only the solipsist’s introspection is evidence of consciousness, everything else is inference. So that’s a dead end scientifically.

One might also consider quantum mechanics again: some interpretations allow for “consciousness causes collapse.” Those are often deemed unscientific because you can’t measure the consciousness in the lab, only its supposed effects, which could always be explained by other mechanisms. If one did a Wigner’s friend experiment with an AI observer inside, a solipsist might predict the AI (not truly conscious) will not collapse the wavefunction, whereas a human would. If one could build a high-fidelity AI and run such a test, and if by some miracle that showed a difference (like interference patterns re-emerging only for AI friend and not human friend), that would support something wild like this. But that’s a long shot and mainstream physics expects no such difference – conscious or not, any irreversible measurement should collapse the state. If that mainstream view held, it wouldn’t refute solipsism (since the solipsist could say “the AI collapsed it just because I was aware of the AI’s result ultimately”), but if it went the other way it might weirdly give credence to consciousness’s uniqueness. This is speculation; real experiments have not indicated such discrepancy as of yet.

### 7.3 Philosophical Implications

Is this solipsistic physics a genuine scientific hypothesis or more of a “poetic abstraction,” as the prompt asks? Arguably, it’s more the latter. It takes the hard problem of consciousness and the interpretation of quantum mechanics and mashes them into a grandiose personal cosmology. It’s stimulating to contemplate, but it conflicts with the communal, objective stance of science. Science assumes multiple observers can verify phenomena; a solipsist theory undercuts that by saying those other verifications are part of one observer’s dream.

However, one could see a **positive philosophical angle**: It forces us to think carefully about why we insist on an external reality. The solipsist model is a foil that highlights how *crucial yet mysterious* consciousness is. It’s telling that to incorporate mind as fundamental, we had to break or bend so many physical principles – maybe this underscores the idea that consciousness really might demand new physics (as Penrose and others have thought). Or conversely, that taking consciousness as fundamental leads to a non-empirical framework, hence we keep it separate in physics.

Another implication is ethical or existential: if I truly accepted solipsism, would I act differently? In a fully solipsist reality, harming others is essentially harming aspects of yourself, and physical risks might be viewed as under your mind’s control to some extent. This might engender either a sense of safety (“nothing can truly destroy me except my own thoughts”) or extreme egotism. But if the physics rule set is rigid (the mind has constrained itself to certain laws), then one must behave *as if* the world were external to avoid unpleasant surprises. In effect, even a solipsist must respect physics as they perceive it, which in practice is the same as respecting it as real. So the distinction may not matter for how they live day to day – which Bertrand Russell once quipped about solipsism: it’s irrefutable but not very satisfying or useful.

**Science-compatible metaphysical hypothesis or poetic abstraction?** It leans metaphysical. There’s a reason solipsism is seldom discussed in physics literature: it doesn’t lead to new calculations or solve puzzles (except the ultimate puzzle of why anything exists – it solves that by saying “only I exist, that’s why!” which is more a dismissal than a solution). It’s more akin to a philosophical thought experiment that can be overlaid on physics without changing physics’ predictions. Thus it is not falsifiable and not competitive with standard physical theories.

That said, it can be framed as a *coherent interpretation* of all phenomena (like a super-interpretation that includes consciousness). It doesn’t directly conflict with any experimental data; it only conflicts with the philosophical stance of realism and other minds. For some, that is too high a price, for others, it’s just a different worldview. In a way, it’s similar to how one can interpret quantum mechanics with many-worlds or with Copenhagen – the math is same, the ontology differs. Solipsism could be an “interpretation of the entire universe” rather than an alternate math theory.

One might also ask: could an advanced theory (say in quantum gravity or cosmology) actually make room for something like a single observer-centric formulation explicitly? If one day we had a theory of consciousness in physics (like IIT being formalized, or some quantum mind theory validated), and it turned out that indeed to define the universe’s quantum state properly one must pick a reference of information (like QBism’s personalist probability), it might inch toward a more relational or even single-observer framework. Some writings by physicists hint that the concept of a strictly objective, God’s-eye view might be replaced by an interlocking network of observations (e.g., Rovelli’s RQM, Wheeler’s participatory universe). These still assume many observers, but conceptually, if you shrink the network to one node, you get solipsism. So maybe solipsism is a limiting case (albeit singular) of these relational ideas.

In conclusion, representing solipsism within theoretical physics language has been an exercise in pushing the boundaries of who or what physics is about. We saw that by tweaking frameworks like quantum mechanics (with collapse by a special mind), general relativity (with an observer-centered metric), string theory (embedding mind in higher dimensions), we **can** construct a model that is mathematically elaborate and consistent with one consciousness being fundamental. It is a **fluid essay** of ideas – heavy on speculation, lighter on hard predictions – but it highlights intriguing intersections: information theory, observer-dependence, and idealist philosophy. Whether one takes it as a serious possibility or a fanciful extreme, it is a testament to the versatility of theoretical physics that we can even attempt to map such a profound philosophical position onto equations and principles. In the end, solipsistic physics might best be appreciated as a philosophical **mirror**: by considering a universe-of-one, we come to appreciate why we usually assume a universe-of-many, and what it would mean scientifically if that assumption is wrong or unnecessary. It stretches our imagination – and indeed, in a solipsist reality, that’s all there is in the first place.
