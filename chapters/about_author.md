## About the Author

**Todd B. Smith** holds a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Central
Florida, where his graduate work explored the abstract structures underlying
modern physics. After teaching mathematics at the college level, he transitioned
into software engineering and currently leads Android development at Disney,
building apps used by millions of guests.

This book grew from years of late-night reading at the intersection of physics,
philosophy, and consciousness studies—a personal exploration of how far
observer-dependence can be pushed while remaining internally consistent. It
makes no claims to revolutionary physics, only to an interesting thought
experiment.

He lives in Massachusetts.
