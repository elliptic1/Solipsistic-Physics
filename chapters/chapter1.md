## 1. No Reality Without a Witness: Observer-Dependent Physics

What if the universe cannot exist without someone to observe it? This question, once purely philosophical, has found surprising echoes in modern physics. Quantum mechanics ties measurement to reality in ways that trouble our intuitions about an objective world. Cosmology invokes observers to explain why physical constants have the values they do. And recent work on black holes suggests that physics may need to be formulated from a single point of view.

This chapter surveys several ideas that place the observer at center stage. None of them are solipsism - they stop short of claiming that only one mind exists. But they hint at how a fully observer-dependent physics might work, preparing the ground for what follows.

### Everyday Example
Think of checking your phone for a weather update. Until you unlock the screen, the forecast exists as data in some server, but it is not part of your experience. The moment you look, it becomes real for you - something you know, can act on, and will remember. In a sense, the weather did not exist as weather-for-you until you observed it.

Physics in this chapter works similarly. The question is not whether atoms exist when no one is looking (a question that may have no clear answer), but whether "existence" even makes sense independently of some perspective that registers it.

### Setting the Stage: Why Observer-Dependence Matters

Before quantum mechanics, physics assumed a clear separation between the world and those who study it. Nature followed its laws whether anyone watched or not. The observer was a passive spectator, irrelevant to the physics being observed.

Quantum theory disrupted this picture. The act of measurement seemed to affect what was measured - not because the measuring device bumped the particle, but in some deeper way built into the formalism. The "measurement problem" remains controversial, but it raised a question that classical physics could ignore: What is the role of the observer in constituting reality?

Several responses have emerged. Some physicists treat the observer as just another physical system - no special status required. Others have explored more radical possibilities: perhaps the observer is not incidental but central. Perhaps physical law itself must be formulated with reference to a viewpoint.

These ideas matter because they show that observer-dependence is not just philosophical speculation. It arises naturally from taking quantum mechanics seriously. The frameworks surveyed below represent serious attempts by working physicists to understand what quantum theory implies about the relationship between observation and reality.

### Relational Quantum Mechanics: A Patchwork Reality

Carlo Rovelli's relational interpretation proposes that the properties of a quantum system exist only relative to another system - typically an observer or measuring device. There is no absolute, observer-independent state of the world.

Consider two physicists, Alice and Bob. Alice measures the spin of an electron and finds it pointing up. From Alice's perspective, the electron now has a definite spin. But Bob, who has not interacted with Alice or the electron, describes the entire Alice-plus-electron system as still being in a superposition. Who is right? Rovelli's answer: both. Quantum states are relational, like velocity. Just as you cannot ask "what is the velocity of this car?" without specifying relative to what, you cannot ask "what is the spin of this electron?" without specifying relative to which observer.

This sounds like it might lead to contradictions, but it does not. When Alice and Bob finally compare notes - when Bob measures Alice or the electron - they find consistent results. The consistency emerges through interaction, not from some pre-existing fact about the world.

Relational quantum mechanics shows that physics can be formulated without a single global reality. Reality is a patchwork of perspectives, each internally consistent and mutually compatible when they interact. It stops short of solipsism - there are many observers, each with their relational facts - but it demonstrates that observer-dependence can be made rigorous.

### QBism: Physics in the First Person

Quantum Bayesianism, or QBism, takes observer-dependence further. It treats the quantum state not as a description of reality but as an expression of an observer's personal expectations. The wavefunction is a tool for making bets about future experiences, not a picture of what is "really out there."

In QBism, there is no universal wavefunction - no God's-eye view of quantum reality. Each observer has their own quantum state, reflecting their own knowledge and expectations. When you update your wavefunction after a measurement, you are updating your beliefs, not discovering a pre-existing fact.

This makes physics radically first-person. The equations describe how an agent should reason about their experiences; they do not describe a world that exists independently of any agent's perspective.

QBism does not deny that other agents exist. But it emphasizes that you have no direct access to their perspectives - you only ever encounter them through your own experience. A solipsistic extension might go further: what if there is only one agent whose expectations the formalism describes? Then all of physics becomes the autobiography of a single mind.

### Participatory Anthropic Principle

John Wheeler, one of the twentieth century's most creative physicists, proposed that the universe might require observers to bring it into existence. His "participatory universe" suggests that reality is not fixed until it is observed - and this applies even to the distant past.

Wheeler's famous delayed-choice experiments show that decisions made now can appear to determine what happened long ago. A photon that passed through an apparatus billions of years ago seems to have its behavior settled only when we choose how to measure it today. Of course, no signal travels backward in time, but the past does not seem to be as settled as we assumed.

Push this idea far enough and you reach the Participatory Anthropic Principle: observers are necessary for the universe to come into existence at all. The cosmos is not a stage that existed before observers evolved on it; rather, the presence of observers is woven into its very fabric. We participate in creating the reality we observe.

Wheeler stopped short of solipsism - he imagined many observers, collectively participating in shaping reality. But his insight points toward a more radical possibility: what if a single observer is sufficient? What if the entire universe is structured around one viewpoint?

### Horizon Complementarity

Black holes present a puzzle that forced physicists to take observer-dependence seriously in a new way. When an object falls into a black hole, what happens to the information it carries? An outside observer sees the object slow down, never quite crossing the horizon, with information spread across the horizon like writing on a membrane. But an infalling observer experiences nothing special at the horizon - they sail through into the interior.

These two descriptions seem incompatible. Leonard Susskind and colleagues proposed "complementarity" as a resolution: both descriptions are valid, but no single observer can witness both. The outside and inside views are complementary perspectives, each self-consistent, but not combinable into a single God's-eye view.

This is a remarkable concession. Physics has generally assumed that there is one true description of reality that all observers ultimately share. Complementarity says no: some questions only make sense relative to a particular observer. Asking what "really" happens at a black hole horizon may be as meaningless as asking which twin is "really" older in the twin paradox.

If physics must be formulated from a single viewpoint to avoid paradox, a solipsistic interpretation becomes more natural. Perhaps only one viewpoint ever truly occurs, and all others are theoretical constructs - useful for calculation but not corresponding to additional realities.

### Toward a Universe-of-One

These frameworks - relational quantum mechanics, QBism, the participatory universe, horizon complementarity - represent mainstream physics grappling with the role of the observer. None of them are solipsism. They typically assume multiple observers whose perspectives must be reconciled.

But they show that observer-dependence is not a philosophical extravagance; it may be forced on us by taking our best physics seriously. If the quantum state is relational, if wavefunctions are personal beliefs, if observers participate in creating reality, if physics must sometimes restrict to a single viewpoint - then the gap between these ideas and solipsism becomes a matter of degree, not kind.

In the chapters that follow, we take the thought experiment to its limit. We ask: what would physics look like if formulated for a universe containing exactly one observer? This is not a claim about how reality is, but an exploration of how far observer-centric ideas can be pushed while remaining internally consistent.

The journey will take us through spacetime geometry, symmetry breaking, black holes, cosmology, and the nature of consciousness itself. At each step, we will find that solipsistic interpretations are available - strange, perhaps, but not incoherent. Whether they tell us something deep about the universe or merely about the flexibility of interpretation is a question we will address at the end.
