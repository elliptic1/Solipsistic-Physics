## 1. No Reality Without a Witness: Observer-Dependent Physics

Modern physics already hints that the world depends on being observed. Quantum theory ties measurement to reality and cosmology often invokes observers to explain why the universe looks the way it does. This chapter surveys several ideas that place the observer at center stage.

### Everyday Example
Think of checking your phone for a weather update. Until you unlock the screen, the forecast is just a guess. The moment you look, the prediction becomes the weather for you. Reality in this chapter works the same way: what you observe is what becomes real.

### Relational Quantum Mechanics: A Patchwork Reality
Carlo Rovelli's relational interpretation[^ch1-rovelli] says the properties of a quantum system exist only relative to something else—usually an observer. No absolute state exists. Yet when observers compare notes they find consistent outcomes. This patchwork approach shows how physics can be formulated without a single global reality.

### QBism: Physics in the First Person
Quantum Bayesianism[^ch1-qbism] treats the wavefunction as an observer's personal catalogue of beliefs. Each agent carries their own quantum state; there is no universal wavefunction. In a solipsistic twist, one could say only one agent truly exists, making all quantum events personal information for that mind alone.

### Participatory Anthropic Principle
John Wheeler[^ch1-wheeler] suggested that no phenomenon is real until it is observed. Cosmology may be fine‑tuned for observers simply because without them nothing would happen. Push this idea far enough and the entire universe might be arranged for a single observer.

### Horizon Complementarity
Black hole complementarity[^ch1-susskind] reveals that no single observer can see both sides of an event horizon. Physics may need to restrict itself to one local viewpoint. A solipsistic interpretation goes further: perhaps only one viewpoint ever truly occurs.

### Many-Worlds and Many-Minds
Everett's many-worlds picture imagines the universe splitting into branches for every quantum event. Some philosophers extend this to "many minds." A solipsist can borrow the imagery but insists only one branch—and one mind—is ever actually experienced. All other possibilities are mere might-have-beens.

### Holographic Principle and AdS/CFT
The holographic principle says a region of space can be described by information on its boundary. In a solipsistic reading, that boundary could be the edge of consciousness itself. What we perceive as a three‑dimensional world may be a projection of information held on the "screen" of the observer's mind.

These frameworks stop short of claiming other observers are unreal, but they hint at how a fully solipsistic physics might operate. In the next chapter we attempt to build such a model explicitly.
