## 1. Observer-Dependent Frameworks in Modern Physics

Physics is not entirely blind to the role of the observer. 20th-century quantum mechanics, in particular, elevated the observer’s status: measurement affects a quantum system in ways that defy a strictly objective description. John Wheeler’s *Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP)* famously declared that “no phenomenon is a real phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon”. In Wheeler’s view, observers *participate* in bringing reality into being – even the distant past or far-away regions are “brought into being” by the act of observation. This borders on the solipsistic idea that the universe *depends* on being observed. Indeed, cosmologist Andrei Linde has argued that “the universe and the observer exist as a pair” and he “cannot imagine a consistent theory of the universe that ignores consciousness”. Such statements blur the line between standard physics and a more observer-centric, even consciousness-centric, ontology.

Several existing frameworks incorporate *observer-dependence* in a way that can inspire a solipsistic model:

* **Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM)** – proposed by Carlo Rovelli – posits that the properties of quantum systems are *relational*, existing only relative to another system (often an observer or measuring apparatus). There is no “absolute” state of a system; different observers may give different accounts of the same events. At first glance, this “perspectival” aspect led some to wonder if RQM implies a kind of solipsism (each observer has their own reality). However, RQM maintains consistency between observers through shared interactions: when observers *compare notes*, quantum theory ensures they find the same outcomes. In fact, once decoherence and information exchange happen, “we all ‘see the same world’” in RQM. Thus, RQM **embraces** observer-specific realities but also shows how a stable intersubjective reality arises from interactions. For our purposes, RQM is a proof of concept that physics can be formulated without a single privileged, global reality – reality can be a *patchwork of perspectives*. A truly solipsistic theory would take this to an extreme: only **one** perspective ever actually occurs, with all others being mere potential or simulated perspectives within that one mind.

* **Quantum Bayesianism (QBism)** – an interpretation of quantum mechanics – goes even further in making the observer central. QBism asserts the quantum state is not an objective entity but rather encodes an *observer’s personal degrees of belief* about outcomes. Each observer has their own wavefunction reflecting their knowledge; there is no universal wavefunction for all reality. While QBism stops short of claiming other observers are unreal, it demonstrates how quantum theory can be recast in first-person terms. A solipsistic variant might say: there is only one “agent” in the universe, so the quantum state is *solely* that agent’s catalog of beliefs (and all quantum events are defined relative to that agent). This echoes the solipsistic notion that “reality” is essentially the one mind’s information.

* **Participatory Anthropic Principle & Cosmology** – Wheeler’s PAP (and related ideas like the strong anthropic principle) inspired the view that the universe’s laws appear fine-tuned for *observers* because, simply, if they weren’t, we wouldn’t be here to notice. The participatory twist is that observers are required to *actualize* those laws or certain states of the universe. In quantum cosmology, one might argue that the universe’s history “happens” along a trajectory consistent with the emergence of an observer (the classic example being Wheeler’s delayed-choice experiment suggesting even photon paths billions of years ago weren’t `decided` until observed in the present). Solipsism could be seen as an **ultimate** anthropic limit: the entire cosmos is fine-tuned and actualized for one singular observer. All of cosmic history, in this view, has no independent reality except as the necessary backdrop to the observer’s existence. This is a dramatic extrapolation, but it is conceptually in line with Wheeler’s proposal that “we are participants in bringing into being not only the near and here, but the far away and long ago”.

* **Horizon Complementarity (Black Hole Complementarity)** – Developed by Leonard Susskind and colleagues to resolve the black hole information paradox, this principle revealed a striking limit on objective reality. It posits that no single observer can see all aspects of a system when horizons (like a black hole event horizon) are present. An outside observer sees information spread on the horizon and eventually coming out as Hawking radiation, while an infalling observer sees the information pass into the black hole interior – but crucially, *no one observer can witness both*. There is “simply no reference frame” in which the two perspectives can be united without contradiction. The lesson is that physics may have to “restrict to a single, local point of view” to avoid paradox. In effect, each observer might need their own description of reality, and attempting a God’s-eye view (combining all observers) can violate physical law. This *horizon complementarity* is a concrete example where **perspective** is fundamental. Susskind coined the term “observer complementarity” to emphasize that what is true for one observer (information falls in and is lost) is not true for another (information is reflected at the horizon) – yet no physical law is violated because no one can be both observers. If we take this to a solipsistic extreme, one might say: the **only** internally consistent description of the universe is from one observer’s viewpoint. Any “global” viewpoint that includes what other hypothetical observers would see is forbidden. This is aligned with the solipsistic premise that only one point of view actually exists in reality. In a de Sitter cosmology (our accelerating universe) something analogous occurs: every observer is surrounded by an **observer-dependent horizon** (like a cosmic horizon) beyond which events are unobservable to them. Raphael Bousso noted that in such cases quantum gravity “may not admit a single, objective and complete description of the universe” – its laws might *have to be formulated with reference to an observer, no more than one at a time*. Solipsism would take this observer-centric formulation not as a limitation, but as the literal truth of how the universe is structured.

* **Many-Worlds and “Many-Minds” Interpretations** – Everett’s Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics removes collapse by saying every possible outcome of a quantum event **exists** in a vast multiverse. In MWI, the universal wavefunction branches into non-communicating worlds for each outcome. Although MWI assumes an external reality (the wavefunction) containing all branches, from each observer’s standpoint, they experience only their branch. This has led some to a tongue-in-cheek “quantum solipsism”: from *your* perspective, you will only ever experience worlds in which you continue to exist (the Quantum Immortality thought experiment) – other branches where you cease to exist are irrelevant to your conscious sequence. A *Many-Minds* interpretation (proposed by Zeh, Albert, and others) even suggested that each observer’s mind splits into multiple copies across branches, rather than splitting the world. These quantum interpretations highlight that there’s no empirical difference between “the world branches when others see different results” versus “those others are just constructs in my mind that happen to behave as if they saw results.” In a solipsistic physics, one could imagine only the branch corresponding to the single observer’s experience is “realized” – all other branches (which would contain other observers or outcomes never witnessed by our privileged mind) either do not exist or exist only as unexperienced *potentials*. This would violate the usual unitary evolution of MWI (which keeps all branches), but it could be enforced by a dynamical postulate (e.g. a collapse that *only* the solipsist’s observations cause). In essence, one might fine-tune quantum theory’s parameters so that **the wavefunction continuously collapses in favor of the single observer’s experiences** and never yields “parallel” conscious observers. Such a mechanism would be like Wigner’s interpretation on steroids: Eugene Wigner once argued that consciousness is needed to collapse the wavefunction, implying a special role for the mind in physics. A solipsistic variant would say *one particular mind* (the only real one) is the universal collapser – the universe’s quantum state is constantly shaped by that mind’s observations alone.

* **Holographic Principle and AdS/CFT** – The holographic principle, epitomized by the AdS/CFT correspondence, says that physics in a volume of space (the “bulk”, e.g. an Anti-de Sitter space) can be fully described by a theory on the boundary of that space. All the information in a 3D region is encoded on its 2D surface. This amazing insight suggests that what we perceive as volumetric reality might actually be a kind of projection or encoding of more fundamental degrees of freedom on a lower-dimensional boundary. In a speculative solipsistic reinterpretation, one might imagine the **boundary** not as a physical surface at infinity, but as the “boundary” of the observer’s mind. The *bulk* four-dimensional world that the observer perceives could emerge from information encoded in the observer’s consciousness (the boundary). In other words, **the external world is a holographic projection of the mind’s internal state**. While this is a radical twist on holography, it poetically fits the solipsist claim that the external universe is contained in the self. We could say that the *degrees of freedom* on the “mental boundary” correspond to thoughts, qualia, sense data, etc., and the dual “bulk” description are the physical fields and particles we normally think of as reality. Some philosophers and physicists entertaining idealist models have hinted at such ideas. For instance, physicist Bernard Carr, working in brane cosmology (an M-theory inspired framework), argues that consciousness may reside in higher-dimensional space from which our 4D spacetime emerges, making his view “highly compatible with objective idealism”. In a similar spirit, one could envisage the **mind as a 3-brane** in an 11-dimensional M-theory: all physical phenomena (gravity, particles, etc.) are excitations or holographic images on this brane, and there are no other branes corresponding to other minds. Carr’s approach essentially inserts consciousness into the fabric of higher-dimensional physics – a step toward bridging subjective experience and string/M-theory.

In summary, while mainstream physics does not endorse solipsism, it has developed **tools for observer-focused descriptions**. Quantum mechanics teaches us that the observer cannot always be removed from the equations; cosmology’s anthropic reasoning teaches that a universe hospitable to an observer is special; and modern theory hints that perhaps no single description can include *all* observers at once. These ideas motivate us to ask: *What if we took the role of the observer to its absolute extreme – a universe with a single, all-defining observer?* To proceed, we first need a mathematical language for a “universe-of-one”: specifically, a **spacetime metric** or geometry that encodes the primacy of the lone self.
