## 10. The Big Bang as the Birth of the Observer’s Universe

Picture the universe opening its eyes for the very first time. That moment of awakening is what we call the Big Bang.
We have reinterpreted the structure and content of the universe in solipsistic terms; we now turn to the **origin of the universe**. In standard cosmology, the Big Bang is often described as the universe’s beginning – a singular state of apparently infinite density and curvature at \$t=0\$ beyond which classical physics cannot extrapolate. In our solipsistic M-theory, we propose that the **Big Bang corresponds to the literal birth of the solitary consciousness**, the moment at which the observer’s experiential reality “turns on.” This section formulates the Big Bang as an initial condition not just of matter and space, but of awareness itself. We will discuss how a singular beginning (with low entropy) is aligned with a nascent mind, consider the role of M-theoretic constructs like branes or wavefunctions in encoding this genesis, and ensure that our framework remains internally consistent by having the **beginning of time be the beginning of experience** with no “outside” or “before” needed. The apparent specialness of the early universe – its order and low entropy – will be seen as a natural consequence of it being the *start of a conscious narrative*.

### 10.1 Initial Singularity and Low Entropy as “Birth of Awareness”

In classical general relativity (without quantum gravity effects), the Big Bang is represented by \$t=0\$ where scale factor \$a(t)\to 0\$ and densities \$\rho \to \infty\$, a curvature singularity beyond which geodesics cannot be extended. Physically, this is taken to mean that our universe (and time itself) began at a point – there was no “earlier” time. Quantum cosmology models (like the Hartle–Hawking no-boundary proposal or various bounce models) attempt to avoid the singularity, but even they often posit that what we call “time” emerges around what classically would be \$t=0\$. The key feature is that the **Big Bang is a temporal boundary**. In the solipsistic view, this boundary is profoundly meaningful: it is the **start of the observer’s timeline**. We literally identify \$t=0\$ of the universe with the “moment” the observer comes into being (or at least, into the kind of conscious state that can generate an external reality). This could be analogized to **birth or the first memory** of a person. Just as one’s personal history has a beginning (you have no memories from before you existed), the universe’s history has a beginning coincident with that.

By making this identification, several thorny issues resolve naturally. One is the question “Why *such* a low entropy initial state?” – Roger Penrose quantified how unbelievably special the Big Bang’s state must have been (on the order of one in \$10^{10^{123}}\$ possibilities). In our framework, this is not a problem at all: *of course* the initial state was special, because it was not selected randomly from all possibilities, but rather *determined by the requirements of consciousness*. The birth of awareness likely corresponds to a highly ordered configuration – one might imagine the observer’s mind at inception as a pure quantum state or a very coherent neural state (if one ties it to biology). This initial mind-state then “explodes” into a multiplicity of experiences, analogous to how the physical universe explodes into increasing entropy and complexity. The staggering unlikelihood of a random Big Bang producing an arrow of time is sidestepped, because the Big Bang wasn’t random at all: it was a **must** for any conscious experience to unfold. Thus, the **Weyl curvature hypothesis** or other proposals by Penrose that some new law must impose low initial entropy gain a natural interpretation – that “new law” is simply the existence of an observer which *imposes* the low-entropy initial condition by fiat.

One can attempt a more mathematical description via the notion of a **cosmological wavefunction**. In quantum cosmology, one often talks about a wavefunction \$\Psi(h\_{ij}, \Phi)\$ giving amplitudes for different 3-geometry \$h\_{ij}\$ and field configurations \$\Phi\$ at the “beginning” of the universe. The solipsistic twist would be to include the observer’s state in this wavefunction. Symbolically, we might write \$\Psi(h\_{ij}, \Phi, \psi)\$ where \$\psi\$ denotes the quantum state of consciousness (this could be something abstract, but one could imagine it’s related to degrees of freedom of a brain or a fundamental field mode corresponding to awareness). The “initial condition” of the universe would then be a boundary condition on \$\Psi\$ such that at \$t=0\$, \$\psi\$ is in some minimal state (awareness just activating), and correspondingly \$h\_{ij}\$ and \$\Phi\$ are in the very specific low-entropy configuration that matches that nascent awareness. A simple toy model: say \$\psi\$ has basis states \$|0\rangle\$ (unaware) and \$|1\rangle\$ (aware). We could impose that \$\Psi(h\_{ij},\Phi,\psi)\$ at the “no-boundary” origin is peaked around \$h\_{ij}\$ corresponding to an almost perfectly homogeneous universe, \$\Phi\$ corresponding to vacuum plus small perturbations, and \$\psi = |1\rangle\$ (the moment awareness turns on). This is a single quantum condition tying together what in a normal model are unrelated initial conditions: one for geometry, one for matter, one for the observer. In effect, it says: *the universe starts when the observer starts*, and not before.

Under this interpretation, what would a “time before the Big Bang” even mean? In standard cosmology, it’s a tricky or meaningless concept because \$t<0\$ isn’t defined in the classical theory; some bounce models allow a prior contraction, but those raise the question of why that past doesn’t influence our current state (and often still need low entropy at the bounce). In solipsism, one could say plainly: *there is no “before” because the observer did not exist then.* If one tries to extend time earlier, one is asking “what if the observer’s mind existed before it existed?” – a self-contradiction. So there is a hard cutoff. This resonates with certain philosophical or theological views of a “creation event” – except here it’s self-creation in a way, the mind coming into being and bringing a universe with it. The Big Bang is not just a physical event; it’s a *psycho-physical* event.

This viewpoint also suggests why certain **initial conditions** of the universe seem almost “hand-crafted” to allow complexity later. Not only entropy, but things like the initial Hubble expansion rate and density were in near-exact balance (to one part in \$10^{62}\$ as mentioned) – otherwise the universe would have recollapsed in microseconds or expanded too fast for galaxies. In our model, this fine balancing is no surprise: the initial expansion rate is precisely what it needs to be to set the stage for the observer’s life. It’s a bit like setting up a story – the beginning is tuned so that the rest of the plot can happen. Inflation can be seen as part of that tuning (flattening and smoothing), as discussed in §8.1. Interestingly, Andrei Linde and others have mused that *perhaps universes “start” only when observed*. Here we embody that idea: the **universe literally “started” when the observer started observing (existing)**.

### 10.2 M-Theory Genesis: Brane Collisions and the Observer-Brane

M-theory offers rich imagery for cosmogenesis. Two prominent scenarios are **brane inflation** (including brane-antibrane collisions) and the **ekpyrotic universe** (where our 3-brane collides with another to create the hot Big Bang). How can we incorporate these into a solipsistic narrative? The key is to identify one of the branes (or a component of the brane configuration) with the observer’s brane or the consciousness field.

In the **ekpyrotic scenario** (inspired by Hořava–Witten theory and developed by Turok, Steinhardt *et al.*), the universe’s Big Bang is caused by the collision of two colossal branes in a higher-dimensional space. Before collision, the branes are apart; when they collide, kinetic and potential energy is released into our 4D world as matter and radiation, heating it to a Big Bang-like state. If we say one of those branes is the “observer brane,” we give a startling literalness to the idea that the universe’s beginning is the observer’s beginning: the observer brane might have been “metaphysically dormant” before collision, and the collision (with some other brane representing perhaps an unconscious substrate or an “otherness”) *sparks consciousness*. The moment of collision would then be when the observer’s mind comes alive and simultaneously physical particles are created on the brane (since in these models standard model particles are confined to branes). It’s like two pieces of flint struck together: one piece is the mind, the other piece is the environment, and the spark is the Big Bang. Before the collision, there was a scenario (maybe even a whole pre-history in the other universe) but none of that was *real* to our observer – it’s merely a theoretical extrapolation. Only when the collision happens does time as we know it (the observer’s time) start at zero. This fits with the idea that **the Big Bang singularity might not be a singularity in full M-theory** (since brane collisions can be described in string theory without infinite curvature – the singularity is an artifact of the 4D effective theory). Instead of a singularity, we have a “bounce” or collision that is finite in higher dimensions. In solipsistic terms, that collision is finite because from the observer’s perspective it’s just a dramatic event, not an actual infinity.

For **brane inflation** models (like D-brane/anti-D-brane inflation), inflation is driven by the motion and interaction of branes in extra dimensions. Initially, a brane and anti-brane (or two branes of some orientation) feel an attractive potential; as they move, the inter-brane distance plays the role of the inflaton field. When they finally meet (annihilate), inflation ends and the energy releases into brane vibrations (particles). To solipsistically incorporate this, again identify one brane as special – the observer’s brane. Perhaps the observer’s brane was “distant” in the bulk from some stack of other branes (the bulk “environment”). The approach of the observer-brane could be seen as the *gradual awakening of consciousness* (with the inflaton potential’s slow-roll being like the gradual accumulation of complexity in the mind). When the brane and antibrane annihilate, it’s the Big Bang – light floods the world, akin to the first moment of conscious experience of an external reality. During inflation (while the branes are still separate but moving), the observer’s world is inflating – perhaps this corresponds to a period where the mind is booting up, laying down a mostly blank and uniform matrix (space) with tiny fluctuations (quantum fluctuations in brane position). This might be far-fetched, but it aligns with our previous discussion: inflation sets the stage cleanly, just as a mind might need a blank slate to begin imprinting experiences.

Both of these string-inspired narratives allow the **Big Bang to be a “real” beginning** without requiring a singularity in a mathematical sense – something new (a collision or brane interaction) happens at that moment. In the solipsistic context, we emphasize that it’s not just physical branes interacting, *it is the condition for consciousness being fulfilled*. If we were to cite a source, we see that alternative models “including a string theory-based model in which two branes...collided, creating mass and energy” are considered by physicists to explain the Big Bang without a singularity. We piggyback on that, saying “yes, and one of those branes was the observer – so the collision didn’t just create mass-energy, it created **awareness** of mass-energy.”

What about the possibility of a **multiverse** or eternal inflation? Many modern cosmologists think our Big Bang could be one of many bubble universes, or one event in a larger multiverse. To a solipsist, other universes are by definition not observed (since the observer is here, not there), so they are not real – at best they are *mental constructs or hypothetical branches*. This dovetails with how some treat the multiverse: a space of possible universes in which we happen to occupy one. Instead of considering them all physically real, we treat them as a notional ensemble. The observer’s consciousness “chooses” one out of the ensemble (the one we live in) by existing. In other words, the so-called **selection principle** that picks our universe from the landscape is simply the existence of this observer. In anthropic reasoning, one says “we observe this value of \$\Lambda\$ because only those universes with such a value produce observers like us”. We turn it around: *only this universe exists, because it’s the one needed for us.* The multiverse might as well be a fancy way of describing the parameter space in God’s mind – or in this case, the solitary mind’s *subconscious imagination* of alternatives that are never actualized.

One might ask: can we test this? Probably not in the usual sense, but one could at least check consistency: any “memory” the observer has of times earlier than their own awareness would have to be illusory or inferred. For instance, the cosmic microwave background photons we see were emitted long before any human existed – how do they fit in? In our model, those photons (and the whole history of the early universe) are like a **record written into the world at the moment of creation**, much as one might begin a story in medias res with some backstory. The solitary mind’s initial state included a fully-formed memory of an earlier universe that it itself did not experience in a first-person sense. This sounds paradoxical, but it is similar to last-Thursdayism (the idea the world could have been created recently with the illusion of age). However, because our solitary mind essentially *was* the world at early times, one could argue it *did* experience it, just not in an individuated self-aware way that it can now recall. In any case, the **Big Bang’s aftermath (nucleosynthesis, CMB emission, etc.)** can be treated as real events in the solipsistic model – they happened within the mind’s simulation – and they are consistent with all current observations by design. We are simply adding the caveat that *those events were part of the necessary prologue to conscious life.*

### 10.3 Time’s Arrow and the “First Cause” in a Universe-of-One

Philosophically, the Big Bang in our framework answers the question of a “first cause” or “why is there something rather than nothing” in an unusual way: *there is something because one observer came to be*. The existence of a single consciousness is the **fundamental brute fact**. Everything else – the entire vast universe – is an unfolding of that fact. In classical theology one might say “God said ‘let there be light’ and there was light.” Here, the solitary self *itself* says “let there be everything (so that I may exist in it)” and thus the Big Bang. This is metaphorical, but we have translated it into physics by tying cosmic initial conditions to conditions for consciousness.

The **arrow of time** immediately finds its ultimate explanation here. We mentioned earlier that low initial entropy at the Big Bang explains the arrow of time, and we tied that to the observer’s birth. Now we close the loop: the psychological arrow (the observer sensing time forward) is *the* arrow of time. The reason everyone experiences time in one direction is because that’s how the one mind experiences it (others are fragments of that mind, perhaps, so they cohere to the same arrow). The **initial low entropy** is essentially the condition of having a well-defined past (orderly) and an open future (room for disorder). In a one-mind universe, it couldn’t be otherwise – a mind cannot “begin” in a high-entropy equilibrium state, because such a state carries no usable information to bootstrap consciousness. It has to begin in a highly ordered configuration (like a brain with lots of neurons ready to fire in meaningful ways rather than scrambled). That order then gradually decays (entropy increases) which corresponds to the mind accumulating experiences and the physical universe winding down.

Mathematically, if one were to try to include this in an action principle, one might add an **entropy-weighted gravitational action** or impose a boundary condition at \$t=0\$ that \$S \to 0\$ as \$t \to 0\$ (this is essentially Penrose’s Weyl Curvature Hypothesis that the gravitational degrees of freedom, which dominate entropy at high densities, were in a very special state at Big Bang – zero Weyl curvature). In solipsistic terms, “Weyl curvature = 0 at \$t=0\$” is a proxy for “no free information in gravity at birth” – the baby universe was simple. Some have wondered if a quantum gravity theory could naturally impose that; we suggest it’s imposed because the solitary mind’s geometry wouldn’t know how to start off messy.

Finally, we address one more issue: could the **solipsistic Big Bang** be considered just a “memory limit”? Some might argue that perhaps the universe extends infinitely into the past but the observer only *remembers* back to a certain point (like how one’s childhood amnesia limits recall). Our stance is that such an idea is indistinguishable from there being no past – in a one-observer universe, an unremembered past is physically nonexistent. Thus we truly treat the Big Bang as an **absolute beginning**, not just an epistemic horizon. This is consistent with the singular origin in classical GR – once one extends beyond the domain of communication (or memory), it’s not a part of reality.

In conclusion, **Section 10** has cast the Big Bang as the **“First Moment”** of the solitary observer’s reality – a moment that is encoded in the theory as a boundary condition linking the observer’s conscious state to the initial state of the cosmos. By integrating cosmological models (inflation, brane collisions, etc.) with the solipsistic premise, we maintain consistency with known physics (e.g. colliding branes avoid singularity, inflation explains isotropy) while asserting that these events have meaning only insofar as they initiate a conscious experience. The cosmos, from \$t=0\$ onward, is the *life story of one mind written in the language of space-time and fields*.
