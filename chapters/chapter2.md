## 2. Center of the Universe—You: Crafting a Solipsistic Spacetime

**Copernicus was wrong—at least for you.**

The Copernican revolution taught us we're not special: Earth isn't the center, the Sun isn't special, our galaxy is unremarkable. But what if physics could be rewritten with you genuinely at the center—not metaphorically, but mathematically?

The frameworks in the previous chapter—relational quantum mechanics, QBism, the participatory universe—all hint at observer-dependence, but they stop short of full solipsism. They acknowledge that physics might need observers, but assume many observers coexist. We now take the next step: What if there is only one?

Imagine the cosmos arranged so that **you** truly sit at its center. What kind of geometry could such a personal universe require? In Einstein's relativity[^ch2-einstein], the metric $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ describes distances, durations, and light-cones for any observer. Ordinarily no location is special; the equations treat all worldlines equally.

To explore solipsism, we instead look for a metric where a single worldline—yours—anchors space and time.

### Everyday Example
Using a navigation app, the map always keeps your dot in the middle and pivots as you turn. Streets and landmarks seem to rotate around you. A solipsistic spacetime would treat the entire universe that way—everything laid out relative to your path.

### 2.1 Building Space and Time Around You

Before getting technical, let's sketch what this geometry must achieve.
In a solipsistic metric, distances, durations, and even causal structure might be defined *in terms of the observer*. Key conceptual requirements could be:

* **Central Observer Worldline**: There is one timelike worldline $W$ (the observer’s worldline through spacetime) which we treat as fundamental. This worldline could be considered the “origin” of spacetime both spatially and temporally. Physical distances and times will be measured relative to $W$. Formally, one might assign this worldline to fixed coordinates (e.g. $r=0$ in spherical coordinates centered on the observer). The metric should remain regular on $W$ (the observer should not see themselves at a singularity).

* **Observer-Centered Symmetry**: The metric might naturally be taken as spherically symmetric around $W$ (since if no other structure is fundamental, symmetry about the observer’s location is a plausible simplifying assumption). In standard cosmology or black hole solutions, spherical symmetry leads to a line element where the time component and radial component are functions of radius and time, with an angular piece that looks like the usual 2-sphere. For an observer-centric universe, one could similarly have a metric that in the observer’s rest frame has purely radial dependence. However, unlike a conventional star-centric spacetime (e.g. Schwarzschild solution), here the central “mass” or “source” is not a gravitating body but the *observer’s consciousness*. The metric’s form might not derive from matter distribution but rather from postulates about perception or information (more on that below).

* **Breaking of Homogeneity**: In a usual Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) cosmology, the Cosmological Principle says the universe is homogeneous and isotropic (no preferred center). A solipsistic cosmos **must violate homogeneity**: it is inherently centered on the observer, so isotropy might hold (things could look the same in all directions to the observer), but there is a strong radial gradient of “reality” – essentially, the farther from the observer, the less real or less determined things might be. We could encode this by a metric function that changes with $r$ in a way reflecting (for example) the *observer’s uncertainty or interaction level* with distant events. For instance, one could imagine a metric coefficient that tends to a limit as $r \to \infty$, representing a horizon beyond which the observer cannot receive information (similar to a de Sitter horizon).

* **Observer as Invariant**: In relativity, an invariant quantity is one all observers agree on. A solipsistic model might add a hypothetical "observer field" that weakens with distance.
Think of it like a spotlight on a stage: the scene fades the farther from the performer you stand.

### 2.2 Toy Metrics: Gravity of the Self

As a thought experiment, consider modeling the observer’s “influence” on reality analogously to how mass curves spacetime. Instead of mass-energy as the source of curvature, we use the *mind* as the source.

 Imagine the observer’s consciousness is associated with a mass $M$ (not literally, but as a source term in Einstein’s equations). The simplest way to get an observer-centric metric is to adapt the Schwarzschild solution so the origin corresponds to the observer. In that familiar geometry, the time component is multiplied by $1-2GM/(c^2 r)$ and the radial component by its inverse. Here $M$ is a playful stand-in for consciousness: the geometry bends around the mind just as it would around mass.


This metric indeed has a special worldline at $r=0$ (where the “mass” is), and is static and isotropic around it. However, a black hole metric is probably not a good model for a conscious observer! The Schwarzschild solution has a central singularity (if $M>0$) and an event horizon at $r=2GM/c^2$. In a metaphorical sense, one *could* whimsically say the solipsist’s mind is like a black hole that no information leaves unless it is scattered at the horizon – but that seems too contrived (and the actual phenomenology would be nothing like a normal world).

Instead, perhaps the *de Sitter* metric offers a more apt template. A de Sitter universe (with a cosmological constant but no ordinary matter) has the property that any given observer sees a horizon around them at a certain radius, and cannot see beyond it. In static coordinates centered on an observer, the time component is multiplied by $(1 - H^2 r^2)$ and the radial component by its reciprocal; the horizon sits where $r$ equals $H^{-1}$. Think of $H^{-1}$ as the radius of a cosmic spotlight beyond which the stage is dark.
Here, there is a horizon at $r = H^{-1}$ (where $g\_{tt}$ goes to zero and $g\_{rr}$ diverges), meaning an observer at $r=0$ can only access events with $r < H^{-1}$. This is intriguingly similar to a solipsistic cutoff: the world the observer can interact with is finite in extent. If we treat $H^{-1}$ as the “radius of reality” for the observer, beyond which nothing definite exists, we have a tangible geometric picture of a universe-of-one. In fact, one could tune $H$ such that $H^{-1}$ encompasses, say, the distance light could have traveled since the observer’s birth (so events outside have never been and will never be observed by them and remain undefined). This *horizon* idea resonates with the solipsist claim that “unobserved = nonexistent.” In a de Sitter analogy, regions beyond the horizon are causally disconnected (unobservable), and one might say they have no concrete existence for the observer.





However, pure de Sitter space is still symmetric for any observer; any observer can claim to be at the center of their own horizon of radius $H^{-1}$. In a one-mind universe, we would assert that *only one* such de Sitter frame is the actual world – the symmetry that allows others to exist is broken. We could imagine a *universe that is globally de Sitter*, but we designate one worldline as the \* ontologically real\* observer. All other “observers” in de Sitter (who would have their own horizons) are in this scenario not true observers at all, but entities within the single observer’s horizon whose consciousness we deny (they would be philosophical zombies, effectively). The metric mathematically would not reveal which observer is the “real” one – that has to be an additional postulate or hidden variable (like our field $O(x)$ above, which is 1 along one worldline and 0 elsewhere).
Some writers even speculate that space itself fades away at great distances from the observer.

### 2.3 Geodesics and Mind-Relative Causality

If we had such a solipsistic metric, how would physics in it differ? Geodesics (the paths of free-falling objects or light) would be distorted to always bend toward the observer’s worldline if the metric “pulls in” space at large $r$. It’s conceivable that *all geodesics might terminate on the observer’s worldline*, meaning every particle or photon eventually reaches the center (or originated from it). This is an extreme case – akin to a universe where the observer is a gravitational attractor or an unavoidable sink. That would actually be physically testable (we don’t see all objects falling towards us!), so a realistic solipsistic model must mimic the successful features of standard physics as experienced. The one real observer sees other people, planets, etc., apparently moving *independently*, so the effective physics in their frame must look normal. The difference is behind the scenes: those other entities are not fundamental and would dissolve without the observer’s presence.

Causal structure might be reinterpreted as well. Normally, causality is an observer-independent notion – lightcones structure spacetime for everyone. In an observer-primacy model, we might say: an event *A* can influence event *B* only if the influence propagates through the observer (directly or indirectly). Perhaps all chains of cause and effect must, in the end, have the observer’s mind as an intermediary. This is truly radical and seems to violate ordinary observation (we see matter interact with matter all the time without our intervention). But a solipsist might argue those other interactions are *part of the script* being generated for the observer’s benefit – the real causation is the mind’s underlying will or narrative making it appear as though external causes are operating. In physical terms, one could impose that **all viable paths between any two events in spacetime must intersect $W$** (the observer’s worldline). That would ensure no event has an autonomous existence separate from the observer. However, this is practically untenable in a literal sense (it would imply, e.g., two distant stars cannot collide unless somehow the observer is involved – clearly too strong, unless one says the stars and their collision are purely mental constructs orchestrated by the mind).

Perhaps a softer condition: the *Global structure* of spacetime might be such that the observer’s worldline is geodesically complete (extends indefinitely) while all other worldlines (representing “objects” or other people) are incomplete in the absence of the observer. For example, if the observer were removed, the metric could collapse or degenerate. This is reminiscent of how in general relativity certain solutions have closed timelike curves or incomplete geodesics unless a parameter is tuned. We might need to “fine-tune” the cosmos such that only with the observer present do things make sense.

Mathematically, an **observer-centric metric** could be engineered to encode the notion of "here and now" vs "far and hypothetical." But it's clear that simply writing a different metric is not enough – one also has to embed this idea into the *dynamical laws* (e.g. how fields behave on this spacetime, how the metric is generated from sources, etc.). That leads us to consider what new fields or symmetry-breaking terms might be needed to single out a lone observer in the laws of physics.

### 2.4 The Moving Observer

A natural question arises: what happens when the observer moves? If spacetime is centered on you, does the center shift as you walk across a room?

The answer lies in distinguishing coordinates from invariants. The observer's worldline - their path through spacetime - is the invariant structure. Coordinates are just labels we attach to events. When you move, your worldline traces a different path through the coordinate system, but the worldline itself remains the fundamental object around which reality is organized.

Think of it this way: in the navigation app analogy, when you turn a corner, the map rotates to keep you centered. The underlying geography has not changed; only the representation has adjusted to maintain you at the center. Similarly, a solipsistic spacetime does not "move" when the observer moves - the observer's worldline simply extends through different regions, and those regions become real as they enter the observer's experience.

This means the "center" is not a point in space but a trajectory through spacetime. The observer's entire history - past, present, and future path - constitutes the axis around which reality is organized. Events that have never and will never intersect this worldline have a different ontological status than events that do.

This perspective resolves what might seem like a paradox: if the universe is centered on me, how can I move through it? The answer is that you are not moving through a pre-existing universe; rather, the universe unfolds along your worldline, with your trajectory being the thread on which everything else is strung.

**Here's where it gets truly strange:** If your worldline is the axis of reality, then every place you've ever been is more "real" than places you haven't. The restaurant you visited last week has a density of reality that a restaurant across the world—one you'll never visit—fundamentally lacks. Distance isn't just spatial; it's a measure of ontological fading. The farther from your path, the less defined things become. Not because we can't see them, but because without your presence, they may not need to be fully rendered at all.

### 2.5 Summary

We have sketched what an observer-centered geometry might look like - a spacetime with a privileged worldline, a horizon beyond which reality fades, and causal structure tied to the observer's experience. The mathematics remains suggestive rather than rigorous, but the conceptual picture is coherent: a universe that exists not as a stage on which observers appear, but as a structure woven around a single experiencing subject.

This notion of horizons as ontological boundaries - not merely limits of knowledge but edges of reality itself - will become a recurring theme. The same conceptual structure appears in black hole event horizons (Chapter 5), in the cosmic horizon that bounds the observable universe (Chapter 8), and even in the boundary between waking experience and dreams (Chapter 6). Each represents a transition between the actual and the merely potential.

Yet a troubling question remains: standard physics is democratic. Einstein's equations work the same for every observer. Quantum mechanics makes no distinction between one measurement apparatus and another. How, then, do we single out just one observer as real? 

Geometry alone cannot do this. We need something more fundamental, something that explicitly breaks the symmetry between all possible viewpoints and declares one of them special.

We need to rig the cosmic lottery so thoroughly that out of all possible minds, only yours could ever win.

That's next.
