## 5. Black Holes and Horizons – One Perspective to Rule Them All
Black holes capture the public imagination because they stretch physics to its limit.
They swallow matter and even light, leaving behind a mysterious surface called the event horizon.
An **event horizon** is the boundary beyond which nothing can return.
Stephen Hawking showed that black holes slowly evaporate by emitting faint **Hawking radiation**.
The information loss paradox arises because one observer falling in and another staying outside seem to disagree about what happens to information.

In a universe with only one true observer, this clash disappears.
There is no second set of observations to reconcile.
From the single viewpoint, a black hole is like a theater with a single seat: the story always remains self‑consistent for that one audience member.
No one else is around to witness any contradictions.

### 5.1 A Quick Tour of the Paradoxes
Ordinarily we puzzle over how information escapes or whether it is destroyed.
The **Bekenstein bound** tells us a black hole’s entropy is huge but finite, proportional to its horizon area.
Physicists worry that tossing information in seems to violate conservation laws.
But with one observer, we can simply say the observable story never splits.
Information that falls in is effectively written out of the script, and no one is left to complain.

### 5.2 Solipsistic Resolution
From the solipsistic perspective, space and time are woven to keep the observer’s experiences coherent.
If our lone observer never witnesses the inside of the horizon, nothing paradoxical occurs.
All descriptions reduce to what that observer can in principle measure.
Any alternative narrative – like a second observer who falls in – is never realized.
Thus the information paradox evaporates along with the black hole.

### 5.3 Horizons as Personal Boundaries
The same idea applies to cosmological horizons.
Only the region inside the observer’s horizon truly enters their reality.
Anything beyond remains effectively undefined until, or unless, it crosses in.
In this sense, horizons mark the edge of what can ever matter in a universe-of-one.

Black holes, then, become dramatic yet surprisingly simple players in this framework.
They serve as reminders that physics may only need to be self-consistent for a single point of view.
