## 5. Black Holes and Horizons: A Universe-of-One Perspective

**Does a black hole destroy information—or does it only seem to, because you can't be in two places at once?**

We have explored how spacetime might center on one observer, how symmetries might be broken to single them out, and how consciousness itself might be treated as a fundamental field. These ideas remain abstract until we test them against specific phenomena. Black holes offer the perfect testing ground.

For fifty years, black holes have tormented physicists with seemingly impossible paradoxes. Information falls in, Hawking radiation comes out, but the math says both can't be true. Countless papers, heated debates, even bets between titans of physics—all because the paradoxes seem to violate quantum mechanics.

But every version of this paradox has one thing in common: it requires imagining what *different* observers would see. One falling in, another staying outside, both experiencing contradictory realities.

What if that's the problem?

This chapter explores how black holes fit into a universe-of-one framework. The central insight is simple: many paradoxes of black hole physics arise from trying to reconcile what different observers would see. If there is only one observer, these conflicts dissolve. The physics remains subtle and fascinating, but the conceptual tangles loosen.

### Everyday Example
Standing on a foggy pier, you watch a boat fade into the mist until it disappears. With no one beside you, there is only your account of where it went. A black hole's horizon behaves like that fog bank: once something crosses it, only your version of events remains. There is no second witness to contradict your story.

### 5.1 What Is an Event Horizon?

An event horizon is a boundary in spacetime beyond which nothing can return - not light, not information, not matter. Once you cross it, you are inexorably drawn toward the central singularity, a point where our current theories break down.

For an outside observer watching something fall into a black hole, the picture is strange. They never actually see the object cross the horizon. Instead, it appears to slow down, its light redshifting to longer and longer wavelengths, until it fades from view. From the outside, the object seems frozen at the horizon's edge forever.

But for someone falling in, the experience would be quite different. They would pass through the horizon without noticing anything special at that moment - no wall, no barrier, just smooth spacetime. Only later, as they approached the singularity, would the extreme gravity become apparent.

These two descriptions - outside and inside - seem to conflict. How can the object both freeze at the horizon and pass smoothly through? This tension leads to what physicists call the information paradox.

### 5.2 The Information Paradox

In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking showed that black holes are not entirely black. They slowly emit radiation - now called Hawking radiation - and gradually evaporate over immense timescales. For a black hole with the mass of our Sun, this process would take longer than the current age of the universe multiplied by itself many times over.

This discovery created a puzzle. If information falls into a black hole and the black hole eventually evaporates into seemingly random radiation, where did the information go? Quantum mechanics insists that information cannot be destroyed - the evolution of any closed system must be reversible in principle. But Hawking's calculation suggested the radiation was thermal, carrying no memory of what fell in.

The puzzle deepened when physicists tried to track information from both perspectives. An outside observer sees information encoded in the Hawking radiation. An infalling observer carries the information through the horizon. But quantum mechanics forbids copying - the same information cannot exist in two places. This "cloning paradox" seemed to force a contradiction.

### 5.3 Complementarity and the Single Viewpoint

Leonard Susskind and colleagues proposed a resolution called "black hole complementarity." The key insight: no single observer can witness both descriptions. You either stay outside and see the information in the radiation, or you fall in and carry it through the horizon. You cannot do both. Since no observer can detect a contradiction, perhaps there is no contradiction - just two complementary descriptions that never come into conflict.

This was already a step toward observer-dependence. Physics was acknowledging that some questions might only make sense relative to a particular viewpoint. We encountered this idea in Chapter 1, where horizon complementarity appeared among the hints of observer-centrality in modern physics.

Solipsistic thinking takes this further. If there is only one observer - the privileged consciousness identified in Chapter 3, located where the consciousness field $\Psi$ peaks (Chapter 4) - then complementarity becomes trivial. There is only one description - whichever path that observer takes. The "other" perspective is not an alternative reality but an unrealized possibility, like a road not taken.

**Here's the truly wild implication:** Black hole complementarity—the idea that reality must be described from a single viewpoint to avoid contradictions—isn't a special case unique to extreme gravity. It's a hint at how reality *always* works. Black holes just make it obvious. The rest of the universe hides the same truth: there can only be one consistent description at a time because there's only one consciousness experiencing anything at all.

Mainstream physics solved the black hole paradox by saying "pick a perspective." Solipsism whispers: you never had a choice. There's only one perspective available. Yours.

Consider: if you watch a friend fall into a black hole, from a solipsistic view that friend is part of your experience, not an independent consciousness. Their "perspective" from inside the horizon is a theoretical construct, not a competing reality. There is no conflict because there is no second viewpoint to conflict with.

Conversely, if you fall in yourself, the outside description becomes irrelevant. You are not leaving behind another observer who sees something different. The external story simply does not happen, because there is no one there to experience it.

### 5.4 What Happens to Information?

In a universe-of-one, information cannot truly be lost because there is no perspective from which loss could be registered. If you stay outside the black hole, the information eventually returns via Hawking radiation (albeit highly scrambled). If you fall in, the information comes with you. Either way, information remains within the domain of the one observer who exists.

This does not mean information is always accessible. The scrambling that occurs during Hawking evaporation is extreme - recovering the original information from the radiation would be practically impossible. But the framework maintains that no fundamental destruction occurs. What the observer once knew, in principle remains encoded somewhere in their reality.

There is something almost reassuring about this picture: a universe that exists as one mind's experience cannot lose pieces of itself without trace. The information might become inaccessible, transformed, or scrambled beyond recognition. But it does not disappear from existence, because existence just is the observer's experience.

### 5.5 Horizons as Boundaries of the Known

The concept of a horizon extends beyond black holes. In our expanding universe, there is a cosmological horizon - a boundary beyond which light has not had time to reach us since the Big Bang. Events beyond that horizon are not part of our observable universe.

In a solipsistic framework, such horizons mark the edge of reality itself, not just the edge of knowledge. This is the same insight we encountered in Chapter 2: the de Sitter horizon as a radius beyond which reality fades. What lies beyond the observer's horizon is not "out there waiting to be seen" but genuinely undefined - potential experience not yet actualized. The consciousness field $\Psi$ from Chapter 4 provides a mechanism for this: where $\Psi$ is negligible, quantum systems need not collapse to definite states. The horizon marks the boundary between the actual (where $\Psi$ enforces definiteness) and the potential (where superposition persists).

This reframing dissolves certain puzzles. We need not wonder what is "really" happening beyond our horizon, because the question assumes an observer-independent reality that the framework denies. There is only what falls within the horizon of the one observer. Everything else is either future experience (if it eventually crosses in) or nothing at all.

Black hole horizons are the most dramatic example. For an external observer, the interior of the black hole is not a hidden region containing secrets - it is simply not part of their reality. Only if they choose to fall in does the interior become real, and at that point the exterior fades from relevance.

### 5.6 The Observer Who Falls In

What happens if the observer - the one real consciousness - enters a black hole? This is where the framework becomes most speculative.

One possibility: the observer experiences falling through the horizon smoothly, continues toward the singularity, and eventually... what? Standard physics says they would be destroyed. But in a framework where reality is experience, "destruction" means the end of experience - the end of time itself, from that perspective. There is no afterward in which to ask what happened.

Another possibility, entertained by some theoretical physicists, is that the singularity is not an absolute end but a transition - perhaps to a new region of spacetime, or a transformation of the observer's experience. Without a complete theory of quantum gravity, we cannot say.

What we can say is that from a solipsistic standpoint, the observer's trajectory is the only trajectory. Whatever they experience is what happens. There is no external vantage point from which to declare their fate.

### 5.7 Holography and the Encoded Universe

Modern physics has discovered a remarkable relationship between information and geometry. The holographic principle, emerging from black hole thermodynamics and string theory, suggests that all the information in a volume of space can be encoded on its boundary surface - like a three-dimensional image stored on a two-dimensional hologram.

For black holes specifically, the amount of information a black hole can contain is proportional not to its volume but to the area of its horizon. This unexpected result hints at something deep about the relationship between space, information, and boundaries.

A solipsistic interpretation might take this further: if reality is what the observer experiences, then the "boundary" encoding reality is the observer's own consciousness. The holographic principle becomes a statement about the relationship between the mind and the world it perceives - the world as a projection of information encoded in awareness.

This is speculative, even by the standards of this book. But it points toward a kind of unity: the observer and the universe are not separate things, with information mysteriously preserved at boundaries. They are aspects of a single informational structure.

### 5.8 What Solipsism Does and Does Not Explain

We should be clear about what this perspective achieves. It does not derive the existence of black holes, predict their properties, or calculate the spectrum of Hawking radiation. Standard physics does all of that, and solipsistic interpretation does not change the mathematics.

What it offers is a dissolution of certain conceptual puzzles. The information paradox arises from imagining multiple observers with conflicting descriptions. Solipsism removes the conflict by removing the multiplicity. Complementarity becomes not just a constraint on what observers can know, but a reflection of there being only one observer to know anything.

This is interpretation, not physics. A skeptic might say: if the predictions are unchanged, why bother? The response is that physics includes not just equations but understanding. How we think about black holes - what questions we ask, what puzzles we recognize - shapes our intuitions and guides our research. A framework that dissolves puzzles rather than solving them may seem like cheating, but it might also reveal that some puzzles were artifacts of unexamined assumptions.

Black holes, in a universe-of-one, are not cosmic trash compactors that destroy information or paradox factories that confound logic. They are extreme examples of what is true everywhere: reality is bounded by horizons of experience, and what lies beyond those horizons is potential, not actual. The observer's perspective is not one among many; it is the only one there is.

Yet black holes represent only one kind of horizon - a boundary in external space beyond which observation cannot reach. But the observer also encounters horizons inward, boundaries where the external world fades and something else takes over. 

What happens when you close your eyes and dream? 

When you imagine futures that never occur? 

When you remember pasts that might be reconstructed or false? 

If reality is experience, these internal phenomena are as much a part of physics as galaxies and event horizons. The black hole's event horizon swallows matter; the horizon of sleep swallows the waking world. One is studied in departments of physics, the other in psychology. But in a universe-of-one, that distinction is arbitrary.

Every night you conduct an experiment more extreme than falling into any black hole: you let external reality dissolve entirely and replace it with something generated from within. And when you wake, one world vanishes and another appears, with no continuity between them except memory.

Which raises an uncomfortable question: how do you know which side of the horizon you're on right now?
