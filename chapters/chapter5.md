## 5. Implications for Causality, Time, and Physical Law

Even the bedrock rules of physics look different if the universe is generated by a single consciousness.  In this chapter we ask how causality, conservation laws, thermodynamics, and quantum randomness behave when one mind writes the script of reality.

### Everyday Example
Editing a movie, you rearrange scenes until the plot makes sense.  Viewers never see the cuts; they just experience a seamless story.  Likewise, the solipsistic universe presents events in an order that keeps the lone observer's narrative coherent.

### 5.1 Locality and Causality
Ordinary physics demands that influences travel locally and that causes precede effects.  In a universe-of-one the mind can quietly coordinate distant events, yet it never lets the avatar of the observer witness a causal violation.  Entangled particles may correlate instantly because they are facets of one awareness, while day‑to‑day experience still respects the speed of light.

### 5.2 Conservation Laws
Rules like energy or momentum conservation can be viewed as bookkeeping devices that keep the story tidy.  The solipsist's mind is free to fudge details, but doing so would create plot holes.  Thus the narrative almost always honors conservation laws, and any tiny discrepancies are hidden from view.

### 5.3 Thermodynamics
The arrow of time mirrors the growth of memory.  As the observer accumulates experiences, environmental entropy increases as well.  The second law becomes a statement that a mind cannot "un‑know" what it has already recorded without erasing part of itself, so history marches forward.

### 5.4 Quantum Mechanics
Quantum outcomes can be interpreted as the mind selecting whichever result fits its expectations.  Because the observer has learned that events follow Born's rule, the mind randomizes outcomes accordingly, preserving the statistics of ordinary quantum theory while ensuring only one branch ever becomes real.

The takeaway is that physical law serves as a self‑consistency principle for the lone observer.  The universe behaves lawfully because the mind composing it insists on a coherent plot.
