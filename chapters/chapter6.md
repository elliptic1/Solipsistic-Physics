## 6. Internal Phenomena: Dreams, Imagination, and Memory in a Universe-of-One

In this solipsistic framework, the boundary between *physics out there* and *mind in here* vanishes – everything is “in mind,” but it appears as two domains (external vs internal) to the observer. We can attempt to integrate phenomena like dreams, imagination, and memory into the physics description:

* **Dreams as Alternate Realities**: As mentioned, dreams could be interpreted as the mind briefly running a different simulation with relaxed physical laws. If we were to describe this with equations, we might say that during sleep, the coupling \$g\$ between the consciousness field \$\Psi(x)\$ and the ordinary matter fields is dialed down. This means the mind stops observing (or caring about) the external environment’s state – effectively “disconnecting” from it. The brain then evolves largely under intrinsic dynamics (which could correspond to a self-contained simulation). The normal metric or Hamiltonian governing the world the mind experiences could morph into another during this period – one that might not conserve energy or have stable space-time (hence dream physics is malleable). Upon waking, the coupling \$g\$ is dialed back up, re-synchronizing the mind with the external environment’s state. Usually, this re-synchronization is seamless (we wake up and the room is as we left it, aside from time passed). One might imagine the mind has to do a quick check: if something surprising happened externally while it was dreaming (say a loud sound occurred), it might incorporate that (the alarm enters the dream narrative, etc.). In our model, that could be represented by a boundary condition: external stimuli can penetrate the dream if above some threshold, effectively entangling the dream state with the external simulation at a point and forcing the dream to adjust or collapse.

* **Imagination and Counterfactuals**: When an observer imagines, e.g., planning for tomorrow or recalling an event differently, they are essentially entertaining a *branch of reality that isn’t actual*. In a single-universe physics, counterfactuals have no physical status except as neural patterns. But here those neural patterns **are** the substrate of the universe, so they kind of are exploring neighboring possible universes. We could say that imagination corresponds to the mind temporarily creating a *superposition* of states or a virtual branch of the wavefunction, but then not actualizing it fully. Perhaps small excursions in thought don’t violate anything because they remain in the realm of internal processing. The theory might incorporate a rule like: \$\Psi\$-field fluctuations (imagination) do not immediately force matter to follow, unless the observer decides to act it out. There might even be a mechanism of **quantum Zeno effect** at play: as long as the observer is just thinking and not observing external changes, the external environment stays in a steady state (not being measured/changed). Only when the observer decides to execute an action or make an observation does one branch get chosen. This parallels how in quantum mechanics continuous observation can freeze evolution (Zeno effect). Here, the mind’s attention can freeze or unfreeze the world’s progression.

* **Memory as the Fabric of Reality**: The solipsist’s memories essentially form the *recorded past* of the universe. We could formalize: at time \$t\$, the state of the observer’s memory \$M(t)\$ encodes certain facts about times \$\<t\$. The actual state of the external world at earlier times, \$W(t\_0)\$ for \$t\_0 < t\$, need only be such that it is consistent with \$M(t)\$ and any physical records that exist at time \$t\$. Thus, unlike in a normal physical theory where the past is fixed once and for all, here the past could be *flexible* as long as it leaves the right imprints on present memory and records. Indeed, John Wheeler even mused about a “participatory universe” where present observations could crystallize the past – e.g., in the delayed choice experiment, the current choice of measurement seemingly determines the photon's past behavior. In our solipsistic interpretation, that makes perfect sense: the mind’s current focus can retroactively choose the story of how we got here, as long as it doesn’t contradict any memories or evidence. If one were to incorporate this in a physical model, it would be highly non-standard. One approach could be a *consistent histories* formulation where many possible past histories lead to the same present, and the theory selects one at random or by some principle when needed (perhaps minimizing action or surprise). This is similar to the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory or the transactional interpretation where present and future boundary conditions together determine what happens. A solipsist could say: my present state and my implicit intentions about consistency act like boundary conditions that fix the one classical history out of potentially many quantum histories.

It’s worth noting that these ideas verge on treating the mind as a *simulation engine* that computes the world in real-time. If one took a computational view, the “hardware” is the underlying quantum gravity or M-theory, and the “software” is the solipsist’s mind content. This raises an interesting question: could a single mind *simulate an entire universe with consistent physical laws* without being overwhelmed? Perhaps the mind uses approximations – it doesn’t compute every atom when not needed (hence unobserved parts of the universe might not be detailed until observed). This sounds like the rendering tricks in video games (don’t render off-screen objects). Indeed, some physicists have speculated about the universe being like a simulation that only renders what is observed to save on computation. Solipsism internalizes that: the mind is effectively doing that rendering. So the **effective complexity** of reality is bounded by the mind’s complexity. This could be a testable consequence: maybe the apparent complexity of far-away unobserved phenomena is limited or they have low information until measured. There are interpretations of quantum mechanics (like QBism) which essentially say the quantum state is just your information about a system; if you have none, you shouldn’t assume it has a complex state.

In summary, dreams and imagination are like *sub-simulations* or offshoots within the mind, while memory is the *stored state* that anchors the continuity of the simulation. We weave them into physics by considering the interplay of the consciousness field with standard fields and possibly invoking novel principles (like retrocausality or observer-centric constraints) to ensure consistency.
