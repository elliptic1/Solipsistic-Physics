## 6. Internal Phenomena: Dreams, Imagination, and Memory in a Universe-of-One

What happens inside the mind when the outside world fades? In this framework there is no strict boundary between mental and physical events. Dreams, imagination, and memory become parts of the same physics.

### Dreams as Alternate Realities
During sleep the coupling between the consciousness field $\Psi(x)$ and the external world weakens[^ch6-hobson]. The mind can run a looser simulation where ordinary laws need not apply. When the observer awakens, the coupling is restored and the dream dissolves like a pocket universe.

### Imagination and Counterfactuals
Imagining tomorrow's possibilities is like sampling nearby branches of the wave function without committing to any of them. Because these thoughts remain internal, they do not force the external world to change until the observer chooses to act.

### Memory as the Fabric of the Past
A solipsistic past is simply the collection of the observer's memories. Without them there is no record of prior events. Memory anchors continuity and shapes the apparent arrow of time[^ch6-tononi].

In short, internal phenomena are not secondary. They are integral pieces of the single reality generated by the observer's mind.
