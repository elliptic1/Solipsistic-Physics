## 6. Internal Phenomena: Dreams, Imagination, and Memory

What happens inside the mind when the outside world fades? In a framework where observer and universe are inseparable, there is no strict boundary between mental and physical events. Dreams, imagination, and memory become parts of the same reality - not secondary phenomena happening "only in the brain," but integral aspects of the one existence.

This chapter explores how internal experiences fit into a solipsistic physics. The ideas are speculative, but they illuminate the framework's most distinctive claim: that subjective experience is not riding on top of physical reality, but is woven into its very fabric.

### Everyday Example
Consider waking from a dream in which you were late for school. The moment your eyes open, classrooms and teachers vanish, yet the emotional trace lingers. Where did that world go? In standard thinking, it was never "real" - just neural activity. But from a solipsistic perspective, that dream world was as real as anything else while you experienced it. The school existed, in the only sense existence matters: it appeared to your awareness. When you woke, it simply ceased to be part of your experience, like a city you drove away from.

This familiar phenomenon - the complete reality of dreams while dreaming, their evaporation upon waking - offers a glimpse of how consciousness might shape existence more generally.

### 6.1 Dreams as Alternate Realities

During sleep, something remarkable happens: the mind generates entire worlds without input from the senses. Dream physics often differs from waking physics - you might fly, find yourself in impossible buildings, or experience time strangely. Yet within the dream, these anomalies rarely feel anomalous. The dream has its own internal logic.

In terms of our consciousness field $\Psi(x)$, we might say that during sleep the coupling between awareness and the external environment weakens. The field no longer constrains experience to match sensory input. Instead, the mind runs a looser simulation where ordinary physical laws need not apply.

Think of it like a video game that stops rendering the "real" world and instead generates a procedural environment. The underlying system (the mind) is the same; only the rules of the generated world have changed. When the dreamer awakens, the coupling to external reality is restored and the dream world dissolves - not because it was "unreal," but because awareness has shifted to a different configuration.

**A thought experiment on transitions**: Imagine you are dreaming of walking on Mars - the red dust crunches under your boots, the thin atmosphere makes breathing difficult, a massive volcano looms on the horizon. These sensations are completely real to you in the dream. Now you wake to find yourself in bed. Where did Mars go?

The conventional answer: nowhere, because it was never "there." It was just neurons firing. But notice what actually happened experientially: one entire configuration of reality (Mars, boots, volcano) was *replaced* by another (bed, blankets, ceiling). From within experience, this is not the difference between illusion and reality - it is a discontinuous transition between two different worlds, each fully real while inhabited.

If we take this seriously, waking life and dreams differ not in their ontological status but in their stability and consistency. Waking reality persists according to reliable rules; dream reality shifts capriciously. But both are equally manifestations of the consciousness field exploring different constraint regimes. The dream is not a simulation of reality - it *is* reality operating under different boundary conditions.

This perspective treats dreams not as hallucinations or mere brain noise, but as genuine experiences - brief sojourns into realities governed by different rules. The dreaming mind is not malfunctioning; it is doing what minds do (generating experience) while freed from the usual constraints.

### 6.2 Imagination and Counterfactuals

Imagination occupies a middle ground between waking perception and dreams. When you imagine tomorrow's meeting or picture what your house looked like in childhood, you experience something - not as vividly as perception, but not nothing either. What is the status of these imagined scenes?

One way to think about it: imagination is like sampling nearby possible worlds without committing to any of them. You briefly entertain a configuration of experience (what if I said this at the meeting? what if I had taken that other job?) and then let it go. The imagined scenarios never become part of your continuous experience in the way perceived events do.

In quantum mechanical terms, one might say imagination explores branches of possibility that remain "virtual" - they are entertained but not collapsed into actuality. The consciousness field probes neighboring configurations without forcing them to become real. Planning for the future, regretting the past, considering alternatives - all involve this kind of tentative exploration.

This suggests that the mind is not simply a passive receiver of experience, but an active explorer of possibility space. Imagination is the mechanism by which we navigate that space, testing futures and alternatives before choosing which to actualize through action.

### 6.3 Memory as the Fabric of the Past

Memory raises profound questions for any philosophy of mind, but especially for solipsism. If reality is what the observer experiences, what is the status of the past? Does it exist independently, or only insofar as it is remembered?

Consider: you cannot directly experience yesterday. You can only experience present memories of yesterday. The past, as a living reality, is inaccessible. What remains are traces - neural patterns, photographs, written records - that exist in the present and inform present experience.

A solipsistic framework takes this seriously. The past, in a meaningful sense, *is* the collection of memories and records available to the observer now. This does not mean the Big Bang didn't happen or that dinosaurs are fictional. It means that these events are real insofar as evidence of them shapes present experience. The cosmic microwave background radiation, the fossil record, geological strata - these are present phenomena that our minds interpret as evidence of a past.

This view has unsettling implications. If memories are the substance of the past, what happens when memories are lost? When you forget a conversation, does it in some sense become less real? When an ancient civilization leaves no records, did it exist in the same way as one we know about?

**Consider a concrete example**: You remember a childhood friend named Sarah with whom you spent summers exploring a nearby creek. One day, while sorting through old boxes, you find photographs of those summers - but the girl in them is named Jennifer. Your parents confirm: there was no Sarah; Jennifer was your playmate. What is the status of those memories of "Sarah"?

In the conventional view, the memories were simply false - neurons misfiring, names confused. But from a solipsistic perspective, something stranger has happened. For years, your past *contained* Sarah. The experiences with her were part of the fabric of your personal history, shaping how you thought about friendship, childhood, and yourself. Then evidence emerged that forced a reconstruction. Now your past contains Jennifer instead.

Which past is real? Both were real when inhabited. The past is not a fixed territory you look back on; it is a construction that evolves as new evidence appears in the present. This is not relativism or "anything goes" - the physical records constrain what pasts are coherent. But it means the past has a kind of fluidity, always potentially subject to revision as the present changes.

### 6.4 The Problem of False Memories

Here we must confront a serious challenge: false memories. The mind does not simply record the past like a video camera; it reconstructs it, often inaccurately. We misremember conversations, confabulate details, and sometimes recall events that never happened at all.

If memory constitutes the past, what do we make of false memories? There are several possible responses:

**The pragmatic view**: Perhaps the past is simply underdetermined. Where memories conflict with physical records, the records win (since they too are present evidence). Where neither memory nor record exists, the past is genuinely indeterminate - not because we don't know what happened, but because "what happened" has no definite meaning in the absence of any present trace.

**The consistency view**: The mind might naturally tend toward self-consistency. False memories that would create contradictions get weeded out or corrected. What remains is a past that coheres with available evidence, even if it never "really" happened in some absolute sense.

**The humble view**: We might simply admit that this is where solipsistic thinking becomes uncomfortable. If the past is memory-dependent, and memories are unreliable, then our grip on reality is more tenuous than we like to think. But perhaps that discomfort is appropriate. We never had the certainty we imagined.

There is something important in this discomfort. Consider the scientific method itself: we trust instruments and repeated observations over subjective recollection precisely because we know memory is fallible. In a solipsistic framework, this is not a contradiction but a refinement. The observer learns to weight different forms of present evidence differently. A photograph is more reliable than an unsupported memory because photographs are less subject to distortion - they are more stable traces.

This suggests a hierarchy within experience: some present phenomena (like photographs, written records, corroborated testimony) are better anchors for reconstructing the past than others (like isolated memories or vague impressions). The past is still observer-dependent, but rationality consists in using the most reliable present traces available. We construct the past that best explains the totality of present evidence, not the past that feels most emotionally satisfying.

The false memory problem does not refute solipsism - it affects any view that takes subjective experience seriously. But it does highlight how strange the relationship between mind and reality becomes when we refuse to separate them.

### 6.5 Continuity and Identity

One more puzzle deserves mention: the continuity of the self. You wake each morning and feel yourself to be the same person who fell asleep. But during dreamless sleep, conscious experience may cease entirely. What bridges the gap?

The standard answer involves bodily continuity and memory: the same brain wakes up and remembers being the same person. But in a framework where consciousness is fundamental, we might want something more.

**A scenario to sharpen the question**: Imagine you fall asleep Monday night and wake Tuesday morning. During the night, your experience went completely dark - no dreams, no awareness, nothing. From your perspective, consciousness simply stopped and then started again. How do you know you are the same "you" who fell asleep?

You might point to memories: you remember falling asleep, you remember your name and your life. But these are present experiences, happening Tuesday morning. They demonstrate that Tuesday-you has access to Monday-you's memories, not that some continuous thread of identity persisted through the night. For all you know experientially, you could be a fresh consciousness that came into being Tuesday morning, equipped with a full set of memories that feel like they belong to a continuous past.

This is not mere philosophical gamesmanship. It cuts to the heart of what "being the same person" means in a framework where consciousness constitutes reality. If there were eight hours during which you did not exist in any experiential sense, what grounds the claim that you existed continuously?

Perhaps the consciousness field $\Psi(x)$ maintains a continuous (if sometimes dormant) presence along the observer's worldline, even during dreamless sleep. Or perhaps continuity is itself a construction - each moment of waking creates a fresh observer who inherits memories and identifies with the previous one, though no metaphysical thread truly connects them.

This may sound disturbing, but it is not so different from what neuroscience suggests: the self is a model the brain constructs, updated moment by moment. The solipsistic version simply takes this seriously as a statement about reality, not just psychology. Your identity is not a substance that persists; it is a pattern that reconstitutes itself, a story the present moment tells about its relationship to the past.

### 6.6 The Dissolution of the Inner-Outer Boundary

The deepest lesson of this chapter is that the distinction between "inner" experience (dreams, imagination, memory) and "outer" experience (perception of the world) may be less fundamental than we assume.

In standard thinking, perception is contact with objective reality while dreams are subjective fabrications. But if all experience is equally constitutive of reality - if the universe is what the observer experiences - then this hierarchy collapses. Dreams are one mode of experience; perception is another. Neither is more "real" in any ultimate sense; they simply have different characteristics.

This dissolution is not meant to make us doubt that the coffee cup in front of us is real. Within waking experience, the cup has all the reality anything can have. But it invites us to consider that reality itself might be richer and stranger than the neat division between objective world and subjective mind suggests.

The solipsistic framework does not prove this. It simply takes the thought experiment far enough to see where it leads: to a universe in which experience is not something that happens inside reality, but something that reality *is*.
