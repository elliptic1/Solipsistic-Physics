## 7. Evaluation: Coherence, Predictive Power, and Philosophical Implications

How solid is this universe-of-one? In this chapter we test its coherence and ask whether it predicts anything new. We also face the charge that solipsism is unfalsifiable.
At this point, we have sketched an exotic framework: one where the single observer’s mind is effectively the “theory of everything.” It’s a fusion of solipsist philosophy with the language of physics. But is this a *scientific* theory or just a metaphysical narrative dressed in equations? We should examine its internal consistency, its relation to known physics, and whether it offers anything *predictive or falsifiable*.

### Everyday Example
Planning a surprise party by yourself illustrates the idea. You keep the guest list and schedule straight because every detail lives in your head. The plan never contradicts itself, but it also can't surprise you with new insights since you wrote it all.

### 7.1 Internal Consistency and Agreement with Known Physics

One immediate reassurance is that, by construction, our model can be made to **agree with all observed phenomena** – because those observations are exactly what the model takes as input (the observer’s experiences). We can always say, “the world appears as it does because the mind made it so.” This makes it trivially consistent with known physics on the experiential level. We deliberately incorporated principles like Wheeler’s participatory universe and quantum observer-dependence to ensure standard experiments wouldn’t contradict the solipsistic narrative. For example, why do multiple people (who the solipsist sees) all agree on experimental results? In our model, because those people are part of the solipsist’s mental construct, the one mind ensures they report results consistent with what it expects to see itself (and RQM showed how consistency between perspectives can emerge via interactions). Why do physical constants seem universal and not changing on a whim? Because the solipsist mind has internalized those constants as fixed background conditions of the reality narrative – maybe those are akin to deeply embedded subconscious rules that even dreams rarely violate too much.

However, internal coherence can be threatened if we imagine scenarios where the mind might slip. For example, could the solipsist unconsciously create a paradox (like influencing an outcome then forgetting, leading to inconsistent records)? We introduced the idea that the mind/nature likely adheres to a *self-consistency principle*. This echoes the Novikov self-consistency conjecture in time travel (the universe avoids paradoxes). Here it’s the mind that avoids self-contradiction. If one tried to formalize, one might say all events and mental states must satisfy a global consistency condition (perhaps derivable from a variational principle extremizing consistency). This is speculative, but not unprecedented in philosophy of science. It’s almost a form of *coherentist epistemology* applied to reality: the “truth” of any event is its coherence with the whole web of the observer’s beliefs and experiences.

Crucially, does this model reproduce all the **mathematical structure** of physics if we wanted to calculate something? Potentially, yes. We haven’t thrown out Schrödinger’s equation or Einstein’s field equations – we’ve just added a new element (the consciousness field or postulate) that picks a specific solution branch. So to compute, say, a spacecraft’s orbit, we’d still use Newton’s laws or GR as usual (since those are part of the established rule set in the observer’s reality). The solipsism doesn’t change the result; it only changes the interpretation (the spacecraft isn’t fundamentally there, it’s rendered by the mind). In that sense, the model is not *predictively* different from standard physics for any experiment we’d actually do – and that is its weakness scientifically. It’s essentially an alternate interpretation, not an alternate theory with new predictions.

### 7.2 Predictive Power and Falsifiability

By conventional scientific standards, a solipsistic physics would be considered **unfalsifiable**. As John Horgan points out, a theory that postulates unobservable entities or intrinsically undetectable differences (like “others have no minds”) cannot be empirically tested. This “solipsism problem” afflicts all theories of consciousness to some extent – we can never directly measure if someone else is conscious – and in our case we’ve elevated that to a principle (no one else *is* conscious). There is no experiment the solipsist can perform to disprove solipsism, because any outcome is compatible with “my mind made it so.” If something truly unexpected happens, a solipsist can always say “Ah, part of me must have wanted or imagined that subconsciously.”

Because of this unfalsifiability, mainstream science would classify the solipsistic universe model as metaphysics, not physics. It’s akin to the *simulation hypothesis* (the idea that we live in a computer simulation), which likewise is hard to test definitively – any “glitch” we find could be patched by the simulators, and no glitch means the simulation is just very good (or not there at all). Similarly, in a solipsist scenario, any apparent independence of the world just means the mind is working in mysterious ways to surprise itself or follow consistent rules.

**Predictive power**: The model doesn’t obviously yield novel numerical predictions that differ from standard physics. However, one might argue it predicts something like “no evidence of consciousness will ever be found in other entities, beyond behavior.” But that’s already the case philosophically – we infer others are conscious but can’t prove it. Another “prediction” might be that if the solipsist strongly expects something, it will happen (like psychokinesis via belief). But empirically, we don’t see strong evidence that people can alter physical outcomes just by will (aside from their own actions). A solipsist might retort that their will *is* actions, so no wonder it aligns.

Perhaps one testable aspect: if only one mind exists, one could hypothesize that **complex behavior that looks conscious (in AI or animals) never crosses some threshold into true self-awareness**. This could mean, for instance, that AI will always hit a ceiling just before seeming truly sentient, because the solipsist’s mind won’t imbue it with actual qualia. Of course, that’s a subjective call in reality – how would we know? If an AI begs for mercy, we either assume it’s conscious or not. A solipsist would say it’s not, but how would an experiment distinguish that from it being conscious? It wouldn’t – only the solipsist’s introspection is evidence of consciousness, everything else is inference. So that’s a dead end scientifically.

One might also consider quantum mechanics again: some interpretations allow for “consciousness causes collapse.” Those are often deemed unscientific because you can’t measure the consciousness in the lab, only its supposed effects, which could always be explained by other mechanisms. If one did a Wigner’s friend experiment with an AI observer inside, a solipsist might predict the AI (not truly conscious) will not collapse the wavefunction, whereas a human would. If one could build a high-fidelity AI and run such a test, and if by some miracle that showed a difference (like interference patterns re-emerging only for AI friend and not human friend), that would support something wild like this. But that’s a long shot and mainstream physics expects no such difference – conscious or not, any irreversible measurement should collapse the state. If that mainstream view held, it wouldn’t refute solipsism (since the solipsist could say “the AI collapsed it just because I was aware of the AI’s result ultimately”), but if it went the other way it might weirdly give credence to consciousness’s uniqueness. This is speculation; real experiments have not indicated such discrepancy as of yet.

### 7.3 Philosophical Implications

Is this solipsistic physics a genuine scientific hypothesis or more of a “poetic abstraction,” as the prompt asks? Arguably, it’s more the latter. It takes the hard problem of consciousness and the interpretation of quantum mechanics and mashes them into a grandiose personal cosmology. It’s stimulating to contemplate, but it conflicts with the communal, objective stance of science. Science assumes multiple observers can verify phenomena; a solipsist theory undercuts that by saying those other verifications are part of one observer’s dream.

However, one could see a **positive philosophical angle**: It forces us to think carefully about why we insist on an external reality. The solipsist model is a foil that highlights how *crucial yet mysterious* consciousness is. It’s telling that to incorporate mind as fundamental, we had to break or bend so many physical principles – maybe this underscores the idea that consciousness really might demand new physics (as Penrose and others have thought). Or conversely, that taking consciousness as fundamental leads to a non-empirical framework, hence we keep it separate in physics.

Another implication is ethical or existential: if I truly accepted solipsism, would I act differently? In a fully solipsist reality, harming others is essentially harming aspects of yourself, and physical risks might be viewed as under your mind’s control to some extent. This might engender either a sense of safety (“nothing can truly destroy me except my own thoughts”) or extreme egotism. But if the physics rule set is rigid (the mind has constrained itself to certain laws), then one must behave *as if* the world were external to avoid unpleasant surprises. In effect, even a solipsist must respect physics as they perceive it, which in practice is the same as respecting it as real. So the distinction may not matter for how they live day to day – which Bertrand Russell once quipped about solipsism: it’s irrefutable but not very satisfying or useful.

**Science-compatible metaphysical hypothesis or poetic abstraction?** It leans metaphysical. There’s a reason solipsism is seldom discussed in physics literature: it doesn’t lead to new calculations or solve puzzles (except the ultimate puzzle of why anything exists – it solves that by saying “only I exist, that’s why!” which is more a dismissal than a solution). It’s more akin to a philosophical thought experiment that can be overlaid on physics without changing physics’ predictions. Thus it is not falsifiable and not competitive with standard physical theories.

That said, it can be framed as a *coherent interpretation* of all phenomena (like a super-interpretation that includes consciousness). It doesn’t directly conflict with any experimental data; it only conflicts with the philosophical stance of realism and other minds. For some, that is too high a price, for others, it’s just a different worldview. In a way, it’s similar to how one can interpret quantum mechanics with many-worlds or with Copenhagen – the math is same, the ontology differs. Solipsism could be an “interpretation of the entire universe” rather than an alternate math theory.

One might also ask: could an advanced theory (say in quantum gravity or cosmology) actually make room for something like a single observer-centric formulation explicitly? If one day we had a theory of consciousness in physics (like IIT being formalized, or some quantum mind theory validated), and it turned out that indeed to define the universe’s quantum state properly one must pick a reference of information (like QBism’s personalist probability), it might inch toward a more relational or even single-observer framework. Some writings by physicists hint that the concept of a strictly objective, God’s-eye view might be replaced by an interlocking network of observations (e.g., Rovelli’s RQM, Wheeler’s participatory universe). These still assume many observers, but conceptually, if you shrink the network to one node, you get solipsism. So maybe solipsism is a limiting case (albeit singular) of these relational ideas.

In conclusion, representing solipsism within theoretical physics language has been an exercise in pushing the boundaries of who or what physics is about. We saw that by tweaking frameworks like quantum mechanics (with collapse by a special mind), general relativity (with an observer-centered metric), string theory (embedding mind in higher dimensions), we **can** construct a model that is mathematically elaborate and consistent with one consciousness being fundamental. It is a **fluid essay** of ideas – heavy on speculation, lighter on hard predictions – but it highlights intriguing intersections: information theory, observer-dependence, and idealist philosophy. Whether one takes it as a serious possibility or a fanciful extreme, it is a testament to the versatility of theoretical physics that we can even attempt to map such a profound philosophical position onto equations and principles. In the end, solipsistic physics might best be appreciated as a philosophical **mirror**: by considering a universe-of-one, we come to appreciate why we usually assume a universe-of-many, and what it would mean scientifically if that assumption is wrong or unnecessary. It stretches our imagination – and indeed, in a solipsist reality, that’s all there is in the first place.
