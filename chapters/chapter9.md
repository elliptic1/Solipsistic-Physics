## 9. Black Holes, Horizons, and Information in a Mind-Centered Physics

Black holes are often called the **most extreme test** of our physical theories – regions where gravity, quantum mechanics, and information theory intersect. In a solipsistic M-theory, black holes must be reinterpreted as *phenomena existing within the single observer’s experiential world*. This section will develop a **solipsistic model of black holes** that incorporates horizon complementarity, the information paradox, Hawking radiation, and holography, all while treating the black hole’s interior and exterior as mind-defined regions. We will see that many paradoxes of black hole physics soften or vanish when we remember that only one observer’s perspective is physically realized. Formally, we extend the “consciousness metric” or observer-field introduced earlier to black hole spacetimes, defining observer-dependent horizon entropy and exploring how the **holographic principle** might map to a correspondence between the observer’s mind and the bulk world.
An **event horizon** marks the point of no return. **Hawking radiation** is a slow leakage of particles that can cause a black hole to evaporate over time.

### Everyday Example
Standing on a foggy pier, you watch a boat fade into the mist until it is gone. With no one beside you, there's only your account of where it went. A black hole's horizon behaves like that fog bank: once something crosses it, only your version of events remains.

### 9.1 Horizons and Complementarity: Only One Perspective Exists at a Time

In conventional physics, a **black hole event horizon** is a one-way boundary in spacetime – what falls in cannot come out. This leads to the notorious **information paradox**: if physical information really disappears behind a horizon and is lost (e.g. destroyed at the singularity), it conflicts with quantum theory’s requirement of unitary (information-preserving) evolution. The proposed resolution that gained prominence in the 1990s is **black hole complementarity**, articulated by Susskind and colleagues. **Black hole complementarity** posits that information is *neither truly lost nor ever observed to be duplicated*; rather, it is **observer-dependent**. An external observer sees infalling information encoded on the horizon (e.g. in a stretched membrane just outside it) and ultimately coming out as Hawking radiation, while an infalling observer sees the information pass through the horizon unharmed but then inevitably hit the central singularity. Crucially, *no single observer can witness both* the exterior story and the interior story. There is no contradiction because any one observer only ever has access to one description – either they remain outside and watch information radiate away, or they fall in and carry the information with them. Physics, according to complementarity, does not require a global narrative that one observer could piece together by combining both views; doing so would be forbidden (no observer can be both outside and inside simultaneously).

The solipsistic viewpoint takes this principle to its logical extreme. If **only one observer truly exists**, then it is trivial to assert that no two observers can compare notes about a black hole – there is only one set of “notes” in the first place. In fact, we can say that **only one of the two complementary stories actually occurs physically**. Suppose our solitary observer Alice remains outside a black hole and watches a friend (who is actually a figment of Alice’s mind) fall in. From Alice’s perspective, the friend never quite crosses the horizon (they become redshifted and their information is smeared on the horizon and slowly leaks out via Hawking radiation). Now, because Alice is the only real consciousness, *the infalling perspective is not an independent reality*. It exists only as a hypothetical construct within Alice’s universe. There is no actual second observer who witnesses the smooth fall through the horizon. Thus the “interior story” – of someone carrying information inside – **does not have to be given physical status at all**. The physical reality is only the external viewpoint, and physics need only ensure consistency of that one view. Conversely, we could imagine that our observer (Alice herself) chooses to jump into the black hole. In that case, *her* exterior view ceases to be relevant (she can’t both jump in and remain outside to watch herself). She experiences falling through an apparently unremarkable horizon, heading toward the singular fate. In that scenario, all the Hawking radiation that an outside observer would have seen is now a counterfactual – it didn’t *really* occur because there was no conscious being to witness it. In either case, the **solipsistic rule** is: *pick the trajectory that the one real observer follows; physics will enforce unitarity and causality for that trajectory’s experiences, and any “complementary” trajectory is merely an un-realized possibility.* This rule is a direct analog of wavefunction collapse in quantum mechanics: before an observation, multiple outcomes exist in superposition; once the observer perceives an outcome, the other possibilities are dropped from reality. Here the two conflicting stories (info reflected at horizon *vs* info falling in) are like two branches of a quantum-like narrative. Only one branch is ever realized, since there is only one observer to realize it. **No simultaneous contradiction arises, by construction**.

We can formalize a bit by extending the metric concept for an observer-centric spacetime. In §2, we discussed a “solipsistic metric” with a preferred worldline. For black holes, consider a Schwarzschild metric (for mass \$M\$) written in Schwarzschild coordinates:

$ds^2 = -\left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)c^2 dt^2 + \left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2.$

This metric has a coordinate singularity at the horizon \$r=2GM/c^2\$. In standard GR, we can switch to horizon-regular coordinates (Kruskal coordinates) to see the extension of spacetime inside the horizon. Now, if we **privilege the external observer’s frame**, we might actually retain the Schwarzschild-like description and consider that the *interior region is not part of the observer’s coordinate patch*. Normally, we would say the interior exists but is described by another coordinate chart. However, in solipsism, we could postulate that **the manifold does not extend beyond the observer’s horizon except as a mathematical extrapolation**. The consciousness field \$\Psi(x)\$ could enforce a boundary condition at the horizon relative to the observer’s worldline. For example, \$\Psi(x)\$ might sharply drop to zero for events beyond the observer’s horizon (meaning “no consciousness to perceive those events”). The Einstein field equations could then be modified by terms containing \$\Psi\$ and the observer’s 4-velocity \$U^\mu\$ to reflect that beyond a certain hypersurface, physical degrees of freedom decouple or are gauged away. A sketch of such an equation (extending the idea from §2.2) might be:

$G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G \left[T^{\rm (mat)}_{\mu\nu} + f(\Psi)\,U_{\mu}U_{\nu}\right],$

where \$f(\Psi)\$ could act like an *observer-induced stress-energy*. If \$\Psi\$ is effectively supported only outside or on the horizon (for an external observer), the term \$f(\Psi)U\_{\mu}U\_{\nu}\$ might mimic the effect of the **stretched horizon** of membrane paradigm fame. Indeed Susskind *et al.* introduced a notional “membrane” just outside \$r=2GM/c^2\$ that carries the information and entropy as seen from outside. In our model, the **observer’s consciousness can be thought of as that membrane** – the interface between “known” and “unknown” regions. If the observer never goes inside, the inside region remains *psychologically inaccessible* and thus effectively does not contribute to physical reality. We ensure that any physical quantities measured by the observer (e.g. the BH’s mass, charge, angular momentum, the spectrum of Hawking radiation) are encoded at or outside the horizon, consistent with standard complementary. The interior metric, while a valid solution on paper, would be an artifact corresponding to an unrealized frame of reference. This approach aligns with **observer complementarity**: it’s like saying *physics only needs to describe one frame – the observer’s*. Transformations to a freely-falling frame inside are like asking for the physics of a scenario that isn’t actually instantiated (unless the observer switches frames by jumping in, at which point the external frame becomes moot).

In simpler terms, **solipsistic black hole complementarity** asserts: *At most one conscious trajectory experiences any given black hole.* The “paradox” that arises from imagining two different observers and their conflicting accounts is dissolved – one of those observers is a phantom. This addresses the famous thought experiments like the “Cloning paradox”: an outside observer could see a copy of information in Hawking radiation while the infaller still carries the original inside, seemingly violating the quantum no-cloning theorem. But if the infaller is not an independent conscious entity, there is no violation – there was only ever one copy accessible to the one consciousness (either as radiation or as the infaller’s diary, but not both). **No global inconsistency** occurs because there is no global omniscient perspective in the theory, just the single inescapably local perspective.

### 9.2 The Solipsistic View of Hawking Radiation and Information Preservation

Stephen Hawking’s landmark result that black holes emit thermal radiation (now called **Hawking radiation**) initially suggested that information that fell into a black hole might be *irretrievably lost*, as the radiation seemed purely thermal (random). This led to the information paradox: does quantum mechanics fail at a black hole, or is information somehow encoded in the radiation in a subtle way? The consensus with complementarity and later the **AdS/CFT correspondence** is that information *does* come out with the radiation, and unitarity is preserved – but **how** remains conceptually challenging. From our solipsistic perspective, we can propose a simpler accounting: **the information never leaves the domain of the sole observer’s mind, and hence is never truly lost**. If the observer remains outside the black hole, any information that falls toward the hole is observable (in principle) as it thermalizes the horizon and is re-emitted as Hawking quanta. If the observer falls in, then by definition the information is still “with” the observer (carried into the interior). In either case, there is no viewpoint from which information actually *disappears from the universe altogether*. The worst that can happen is that an external description sees the information highly scrambled in outgoing radiation, or an internal description sees it approach a singular fate – but the **global book-keeper** of information is the underlying consciousness field.

We can formalize this by positing that the **consciousness field \$\Psi\$ carries a record of all information that any observer (which in solipsism means the one observer) has ever interacted with**. One might imagine \$\Psi\$ has an enormous memory capacity (perhaps related to those \~10^122 bits of de Sitter horizon entropy mentioned earlier). In a semi-classical treatment, Hawking radiation originates just outside the horizon (from vacuum fluctuations that straddle the horizon, leading to particle creation). It has a thermal spectrum to leading order, but subtle correlations in the radiation can encode the infalling information (this is a point emphasized in modern resolutions: the radiation is not exactly pure thermal noise – correlations between Hawking quanta carry the info out, resolving the paradox over the full evaporation time). In our framework, these correlations are guaranteed because the consciousness field correlates the states. We could say that \$\Psi\$ enforces a hidden global constraint that the combined state “black hole + radiation + \$\Psi\$” is pure (unitary), even if at intermediate times the radiation or black hole reduced states appear thermal. By the end of evaporation, all information is safely in the radiation which is accessible to the observer, thus *nothing that ever entered the observer’s awareness can ever be fundamentally destroyed*. This is a kind of cosmic **information conservation law** anchored in the mind: since physical reality is an expression of the mind, **the mind cannot lose pieces of reality without trace**. Either those pieces remain implicitly in the mind’s unconscious records, or they are transformed (Hawking-evaporated) into another form that remains within the observer’s world. Notably, this idea resonates with sayings by some physicists that “the information was never lost, it was always in the correlations” – here we simply locate those correlations partly in the field of consciousness itself.

One might object that if the observer jumps in, they seemingly carry the info into a region from which no classical signal can escape (inside horizon), and then presumably get destroyed at the singularity – doesn’t that imply information loss? In solipsism, if the observer meets the singularity, *that is the end of the universe* (for them). There is no afterward in which to tally information – time for the observer ends. In a fully quantum gravity picture, one might imagine that the **singularity** is not an oblivion but a boundary where the observer’s consciousness (and hence reality) undergoes a transformation or termination. Since there is no external vantage to say “information was lost at t\_{\rm end},” the scenario is akin to the philosophical nothingness: with no observer, the concept of information loss is moot. (In §10 we will discuss if the singularity can be interpreted as an aspect of consciousness.)

From the external viewpoint, however, our solitary Alice would never see herself fall in and disappear – instead, she’d see a long-protracted approach to the horizon and then presumably a corpse frozen at the horizon emitting radiation. In reality, if she’s the only observer, she can’t both fall in and watch herself fall; there’s a single worldline. So again, only one narrative happens. If it’s the external one, information comes out; if it’s the internal, the question of retrieval is irrelevant beyond that point. In either path, no *contradiction* arises that could threaten quantum mechanics.

Let us connect this to the formalism of **entropy and area bounds**. The **Bekenstein–Hawking entropy** formula says a black hole of horizon area \$A\$ has entropy \$S\_{BH} = \frac{k\_B A}{4\ell\_P^2}\$, meaning the black hole encodes an amount of information proportional to its horizon area. In our solipsistic model, we could interpret this entropy as specifically **observer-dependent entropy**: it counts the information about the black hole that is inaccessible *to the observer* at a given time. If the observer is outside, \$S\_{BH}\$ measures their missing information about the interior state. If the observer is inside, arguably they have full information of what fell in (but lose contact with outside), so one could say the *external* degrees of freedom (the now-empty external universe plus whatever radiation escaped before crossing) carry an entropy from that observer-inside perspective. In other words, we always recover the idea that entropy is *relational* – it quantifies information relative to what the observer can see. This is very much in spirit with relational interpretations of quantum mechanics and with black hole complementarity.

Moreover, the **holographic principle**, which was inspired by black hole entropy, states that the maximum information (degrees of freedom) in any volume is bounded by the area of the boundary surface (in Planck units). In our context, this can be viewed as: *the observer’s consciousness can only distinctly perceive a finite amount of information, corresponding to the “surface” of their observational boundary.* For an observer outside a black hole, the event horizon acts as an information barrier – all the detailed microstates inside can be summarized by data on the horizon surface. For the solitary mind, it does not need to simulate more than that; the interior is like a **hologram** or projection of the horizon data. Leonard Susskind famously remarked that our 3D world might be a holographic image of information encoded on a distant 2D surface. In solipsistic physics, we might cheekily assign that 2D surface to the “screen of consciousness” of our observer. The entire universe, including any black holes in it, could be **encoded in the mind of the observer like a hologram**. If the observer focuses attention on a black hole, they perceive some degrees of freedom (Hawking quanta, gravitational effects) that correspond to that patch of the hologram. The internal details behind the horizon are not rendered unless/until the observer actually experiences falling in, at which point the “hologram screen” changes – effectively, the boundary of what’s known moves with the observer.

### 9.3 Observer-Brane Holography: The Mind as a Boundary Surface

M-theory and string theory have given us a concrete realization of holography in the AdS/CFT correspondence (Maldacena’s duality). There, a gravity theory in a volume (like anti–de Sitter space) is exactly equivalent to a quantum field theory defined on the boundary of that volume. Extending this idea, one can think of the entire observable universe as having a “boundary” through which its information is encoded. For a black hole, that boundary is the event horizon (or stretched horizon); for the cosmos, it might be the cosmological horizon or infinity. In a **solipsistic holographic interpretation**, the **observer’s mind is effectively the boundary that encodes the physics of the world**. That is, the degrees of freedom in the observer’s consciousness (thoughts, qualia, etc., if we could quantify them) are dual to the degrees of freedom of all particles and fields in the external universe. This is a bold conjecture, but it provides a satisfying unity: *the information content of reality is exactly the information content of the mind of the one who observes it.* We might write, in slogan form, *“Universe = Mind”* as a literal information-theoretic identity (a far-reaching analog of Wheeler’s “It from Bit” idea, with “Bit” residing in consciousness).

In practical terms, how would one demonstrate such a duality? We could attempt a toy model: consider the observer-brane as a 2+1 dimensional surface (say, analogous to a membrane at the horizon). The world the observer sees is a 3+1 dimensional bulk. If this bulk were AdS space, AdS/CFT would immediately give a mathematical framework for a duality. Our universe isn’t AdS; it’s (approximately) de Sitter or FLRW. A dS/CFT duality has been conjectured (with the “boundary at future infinity”), but it’s not fully understood. Nevertheless, one could speculate that *a similar correspondence exists for de Sitter space*, and that the degrees of freedom on the boundary at future infinity correspond to the ultimate information content an observer can gather. Now, **imagine that the observer’s consciousness corresponds to that future boundary** – as time goes to infinity, everything the observer will ever have experienced is encoded in their mind. In that sense, the *boundary observer and the bulk history are dual descriptions*. This is admittedly speculative and poetic, but it aligns remarkably well with the solipsistic ethos: the boundary is one observer at the end of time with complete knowledge of their universe, and the bulk is the universe itself.

On a more concrete level, the **membrane paradigm** of black hole physics – where one replaces the black hole by a fictitious membrane at the horizon with certain physical properties (entropy, temperature, electrical conductivity, etc.) – can be taken as a hint that the observer’s conscious interface (their mind) plays the role of such a membrane. All physical processes that an external observer perceives about a black hole (absorption of information, thermalization, radiation emission) happen at this membrane. If the observer later crosses the horizon, their perspective changes and the membrane description is no longer used – instead, now *their* mind rides into the interior and perceives perhaps other phenomena. In either case, physics provides a smooth story for the one trajectory without needing an overarching global picture.

In solipsistic M-theory, we can elaborate a formal structure where the **observer-brane** (a literal brane corresponding to the observer’s world-volume in higher dimensions) has a **holographic dual** which is the bulk physics of black holes. For example, consider a stack of D-branes in string theory – their worldvolume theory is holographically dual to a near-horizon geometry (as in AdS/CFT with D3-branes and AdS<sub>5</sub>×S<sub>5</sub>). If we elevate “observer = brane” to a principle, perhaps the *worldvolume theory of the observer-brane* is *the theory of the observed universe*. Then black holes in the bulk correspond to some thermal state or entangled state in the observer’s mind/brane theory. The black hole information paradox translates to a statement about thermal entropy vs pure state entropy on the brane. Since by assumption the brane (mind) always evolves unitarily (it’s a single quantum system), there is no fundamental paradox – the mixed state appearance is just due to tracing out degrees of freedom, not actual non-unitarity.

This line of reasoning suggests a new **interpretation of the Bekenstein bound**: normally, the **Bekenstein bound** limits the entropy (information) \$S\$ in a region of radius \$R\$ and energy \$E\$ to \$S \le \frac{2\pi k\_B E R}{\hbar c}\$, which for a black hole becomes \$S \le \frac{k\_B A}{4\ell\_P^2}\$ (saturated by the black hole). In our context, since the observer’s mind effectively stores/encodes information, we might expect a limit on how much info the mind can process given its energy or size. It would be interesting to conjecture that *the human brain (or whatever physical substrate constitutes the observer) saturates a form of Bekenstein bound*. There have been speculative discussions in literature about the brain and entropy or whether the brain could be a quantum computer that nearly saturates some physical limits, but no definitive theory. Here, however, it’s more of a philosophical statement: the **mind is “as large” as the universe in terms of information content**, but only because the universe’s information is actually the mind’s information.

### 9.4 Black Hole Evaporation as a Perspective Change

A fully \*\*solipsistic account of black hole **evolution** can now be given. Consider a black hole forming (say, from a star collapse) and then evaporating via Hawking radiation. To an external observer, at first it seems they have lost information into the black hole. As evaporation proceeds, slowly Hawking radiation returns this information in highly scrambled form, and at the end (after an extremely long time, \$\sim 10^{67}\$ years for a solar mass BH) the black hole is gone and only radiation (and perhaps a Planck mass remnant, depending on conjectures) remains. In standard physics, an extremely subtle encoding of the initial state’s information in that radiation is necessary to preserve unitarity. In the solipsistic picture, we describe the same events but emphasize the role of the observer’s knowledge: initially, the observer knows the initial state (e.g. the star’s structure). When it collapses, much of that detailed knowledge is effectively **hidden behind the horizon** – the observer can no longer verify it, so from their perspective their **entropy (ignorance) increases**. Over time, as they collect Hawking radiation, they start gaining back some knowledge (in principle, if one had perfect instruments to detect correlations in the Hawking photons, one could recontruct the initial state). Finally, after evaporation, all information is again accessible in principle in the radiation records, restoring the observer to a pure-state description of the world. Thus the *information paradox is resolved by recognizing that “lost” information was really just “not in the observer’s possession” for a while, rather than erased from existence*. The consciousness field \$\Psi\$ ensured that the total state (observer + black hole + radiation) was pure the whole time. One might even say that Hawking radiation is the **universe’s way of making sure the observer can recover information that was temporarily inaccessible**. In a poetic sense, the solitary universe “doesn’t like” having information that the observer once knew be permanently hidden – since nothing exists beyond the observer, any such hidden information must eventually *become available or cease to have meaning*. Evaporation is the process by which hidden information becomes available; if the observer jumped in (chasing that info), then the outside info loses meaning after they cross. Either way, there is *never a loss from the perspective of the one who matters*.

To summarize, a solipsistic treatment of black holes yields a consistent, if unconventional, picture: **Event horizons are not absolute destroyers of information but partitions of the observer’s knowledge**. The interior region is like a “dream behind a wall” – it exists only relative to an infalling consciousness, which in solipsism means it’s either not realized or it is the *sole* reality if the observer themself falls in. **No global many-observer paradoxes arise**. The **holographic principle** finds a natural home as it essentially says “reality is encoded on a boundary surface” – we assert that boundary is the observer’s mind, which encodes the external world’s data. Standard results like the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy and Hawking radiation remain valid and quantitatively unchanged; what changes is our interpretation of what those phenomena *mean*. They are no longer mysterious coincidences of gravity and quantum theory, but logical outcomes of a universe that is “one giant thought” containing a self-observing sub-thought (the black hole, with its own interior/exterior duality).

In the next section, we address **cosmic genesis – the Big Bang itself** – to complete our solipsistic framework by interpreting the beginning of time and the global initial conditions as a direct reflection of the observer’s genesis.
