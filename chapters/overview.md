## Overview
The book is divided into three parts. Part I builds the theoretical framework, introducing observer-dependent physics and a proposed solipsistic spacetime metric. Part II applies these ideas to cosmology and black holes. Part III reflects on the philosophical implications and open questions. Each chapter represents a first draft, inviting further refinement.

Each chapter also includes an **Everyday Example** subsection that grounds its core idea in a familiar scenario. These short passages provide quick intuition before the more speculative material.
