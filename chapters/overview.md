# Overview

The book is divided into three parts across nine chapters.

**Part I: Theoretical Framework** (Chapters 1-4) builds the foundation. We survey existing observer-dependent ideas in physics, propose a solipsistic spacetime centered on one worldline, explore how reality might be "tuned" for a single consciousness, and introduce a consciousness field as a conceptual placeholder.

**Part II: Applications** (Chapters 5-9) applies the framework with rising stakes. Black holes and their horizons become boundaries of the observer's knowable reality. Dreams, imagination, and memory blur the line between inner and outer. Cosmology reveals the universe structured around one viewpoint, culminating in the Big Bang as the observer's birth - and reality's. Finally, we step back to evaluate what we have built.

**Part III: Reflections** steps back to assess what has been built, what remains open, and what value the exercise offers.

### Chapter Summary

1. **Observer-Dependent Physics** - How modern physics already hints at observer-centrality
2. **Solipsistic Spacetime** - Building geometry around a single worldline
3. **Breaking Symmetry** - Why only one mind exists in this framework
4. **Consciousness as a Field** - A placeholder for awareness in the equations
5. **Black Holes and Horizons** - How the information paradox dissolves
6. **Dreams, Imagination, and Memory** - Internal experience in a universe-of-one
7. **Cosmology** - Inflation, horizons, and fine-tuning reinterpreted
8. **The Big Bang** - Cosmic origins as the birth of the observer
9. **Evaluation** - Coherence, limitations, and philosophical implications

The unifying thread is that the observer and cosmos are not separate. Reality exists because of the observer's awareness, and the universe is that awareness rendered as experience.

Each chapter includes an **Everyday Example** that grounds its core idea in a familiar scenario, providing quick intuition before the more speculative material.
