## Overview
The book is divided into three parts. Part I builds the theoretical framework, introducing observer-dependent physics and a proposed solipsistic spacetime metric. Part II applies these ideas to cosmology and black holes. Part III reflects on the philosophical implications and open questions. Each chapter represents a first draft, inviting further refinement.
