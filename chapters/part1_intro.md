# Theoretical Modeling of Solipsism: Fine-Tuning M-Theory for a Universe-of-One

&#x20;*Conceptual illustration of mind and cosmos entwined. In a solipsistic worldview, the universe is a projection of a single consciousness, challenging physics to accommodate an observer-defined reality.*

## Introduction: From Philosophy to Physics

Solipsism – the idea that only one’s own mind is sure to exist – poses a profound challenge to physics. In this extreme idealist stance, the external world and other observers are mere constructs of a single consciousness. Traditional physics assumes an objective reality shared by many observers, but **could** our best theories be reinterpreted to describe a *universe-of-one*? In this report, we explore how modern theoretical frameworks (from quantum mechanics to M-theory) might be modified or extended to model a cosmos in which a lone observer’s mind generates all phenomena. We survey observer-centric approaches in physics, propose a “solipsistic” spacetime metric, outline the symmetry-breaking needed to privilege one observer, consider consciousness as a fundamental field or dimension, and discuss implications for causality, time, and internal experiences like dreams and memory. The goal is an interdisciplinary synthesis: **physics meets solipsism** in a mathematically bold yet intellectually coherent way. While such a model may blur the line between metaphysics and science, it offers a thought experiment in **fine-tuning** physical laws for a reality that exists only **for** and **in** one observing mind.
