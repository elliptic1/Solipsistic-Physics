# Preface

*What if your mind were the only one that truly exists? Could the laws of physics be rewritten from that perspective?*

This book explores that provocative question. Solipsism - the idea that only one's own mind is certain - meets modern theoretical physics in an accessible exploration. Throughout the following chapters we treat quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology as aspects of a single observer's experience.

### How to Read This Book

This is not a physics textbook. It does not derive new equations or make testable predictions. Instead, it is a philosophical thought experiment dressed in the language of physics - an exploration of how far observer-centric ideas can be pushed while remaining internally consistent.

The mathematics that appears is illustrative rather than rigorous. Where equations are used, they serve to show that solipsistic interpretations are available within existing physics, not to propose new physics. Readers without technical backgrounds can skip the occasional mathematical notation without losing the thread.

The tone throughout is speculative and exploratory. We are not arguing that solipsism is true, only that it is coherent - that the equations of modern physics can be read as describing a universe-of-one without contradiction. Whether that coherence tells us something deep about reality or merely about the flexibility of interpretation is a question we leave open.

In this view, the observer does not inhabit a universe distinct from themselves. The observer's awareness is the universe; reality arises because that awareness does.

By the end, you may see familiar physics in a new light: not as detached laws governing an indifferent cosmos, but as a narrative woven for one consciousness.
