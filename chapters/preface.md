## Preface
This manuscript expands the notion that a single consciousness is responsible for the creation and perception of all phenomena. It blends the philosophy of solipsism with modern theoretical physics, exploring how standard ideas can be reinterpreted through an observer-centered lens.

Throughout the pages that follow we examine quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology not as detached laws but as aspects of one mind's experience. Equations and models are presented in LaTeX so that the mathematical foundations remain precise.
