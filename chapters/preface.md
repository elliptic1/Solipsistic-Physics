## Preface

*What if your mind were the only one that truly exists? Could the laws of physics be rewritten from that perspective?*

This short book explores that provocative question. Solipsism—the idea that only one's own mind is certain—meets modern theoretical physics in a didactic and accessible way. Throughout the following chapters we treat quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology as aspects of a single observer's experience. The aim is to guide curious readers from philosophical musings to concrete equations while keeping the tone conversational and engaging. Equations appear in LaTeX for precision, but each is accompanied by plain-language explanation.

In this view, the observer does not inhabit a universe distinct from themselves. The observer’s awareness is the universe; reality arises because that awareness does.

By the end, you may see familiar physics in a new light: not as detached laws, but as a narrative woven for one consciousness.
