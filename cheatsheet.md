# Solipsistic Physics Cheat Sheet

This quick reference summarizes key ideas from the manuscript **"Solipsistic Physics: A Universe-of-One"**. It condenses the main chapters into bite-sized points.

## Foundations

- **Observer Dependence**: Modern quantum frameworks (RQM, QBism) hint that physical states only exist relative to observers. The book takes this to the extreme: only one observing mind is real.
- **Solipsistic Metric**: Proposes a spacetime geometry centered on a single observer. Geodesics and causality become mind-relative.
- **Symmetry Breaking**: Physics is fine-tuned so that only one observer arises. Exchange symmetry between minds is broken; time’s arrow emerges from the chosen vacuum state.
- **Consciousness Field**: Introduces a fundamental field \(\Psi(x)\) or extra dimension representing awareness. Dreams and internal experiences are treated as legitimate physical states.

## Implications

- **Causality & Laws**: Physical law is formulated from the standpoint of one mind. Standard causal structure persists but is defined by that observer’s perceptions.
- **Internal Phenomena**: Memory, imagination, and dream states are described within the same formalism, blurring internal and external reality.
- **Evaluation**: The theory aims for coherence with known physics yet remains speculative. Predictive power and falsifiability are open questions.

## Cosmology & Gravitation

- **Solipsistic Cosmology**: Inflation, cosmic expansion, and the CMB are reinterpreted as constructs selected by the observer’s mind.
- **Black Holes**: Horizon complementarity is reframed so that no contradictions arise when only one perspective exists. Information is preserved relative to that observer.
- **Big Bang**: Treated as the birth of the observer’s consciousness—time and low entropy begin with awareness itself.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Universe-of-One**: All phenomena exist solely as experiences of a single consciousness.
2. **Mind-Centered Physics**: Geometry, cosmology, and quantum processes are modeled with the observer at the core.
3. **Speculative but Consistent**: The framework keeps equations from M-theory and relativity but recasts them in first-person terms.
4. **Open Questions**: Can such a model yield testable predictions or resolve paradoxes like fine-tuning and black hole information?

Use this cheat sheet as a rapid reminder of the book’s central themes and how each chapter builds a solipsistic interpretation of modern physics.
