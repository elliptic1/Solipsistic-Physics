## AI Image Generation Prompt

Use this prompt with Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Ideogram:

```
Abstract visualization of consciousness observing the cosmos from within,
a single luminous point at the center of expanding spacetime geometry,
quantum wave functions radiating outward like ripples, deep space with
distant galaxies and mathematical equations fading into stars, dark blue
and gold color palette, philosophical and contemplative mood, minimalist
composition with strong central focal point, professional book cover art
style, high contrast, vertical orientation suitable for book cover
```

**Alternative prompt (more minimal):**

```
Minimalist book cover art, single glowing consciousness point surrounded
by concentric circles representing spacetime curvature, scattered Greek
letters and physics equations dissolving into cosmic dust, deep navy blue
background with warm gold accents, elegant and intellectual aesthetic,
clean design with ample space for title text at top and author name at
bottom, vertical format
```

## Adding Typography

After generating the background art:

1. Open in **Canva** (free) or image editor
2. Add title text at top (leave ~15% margin):
   - "SOLIPSISTIC PHYSICS" - bold serif (Playfair Display, Cormorant)
   - "A Universe-of-One" - lighter weight below
3. Add author name at bottom (~10% from edge):
   - "Todd B. Smith, PhD" - clean sans-serif (Raleway, Lato)
4. Export at required dimensions

## Print Cover (Full Wrap)

For print, you need front + spine + back:

1. Upload interior PDF to KDP first
2. KDP will calculate exact spine width based on page count
3. Download KDP's cover template (PDF with guidelines)
4. Place your front cover art on the template
5. Add spine text (title + author, rotated 90°)
6. Add back cover (description, barcode area - KDP adds barcode automatically)

---

## Quick Option: KDP Cover Creator

If you don't want to design from scratch:
1. Go to KDP dashboard → Create new title → Cover
2. Use "Cover Creator" tool
3. Select a template and customize with your title/author
