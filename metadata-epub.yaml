  What if the universe cannot exist without an observer—and what if that
  observer is you? This provocative exploration takes quantum mechanics
  and cosmology to their logical extreme, examining how modern physics
  might be reinterpreted through the lens of solipsism—the view that only
  one mind truly exists.
